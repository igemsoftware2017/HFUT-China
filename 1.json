6065-6074.", "background": "", "description": "We put \u0091spacers\u0092 in between the different binding sites so the mRNA would form a hairpin and allow for a RBS to be exposed directly in front of the programmable cell death gene we wanted to be transcribed.These added binding sites allow for the reporter gene to compete with the sites allow the Kanamycin resistance or other target gene.The thermistor used in the PCR machine was calibrated on a kitchen stove with multimeter capable of reading temperature through its own thermistor attachment.Before further prototyping, it became necessary to test the Peltier chip to see if it could reach temperatures of 95\u00b0C.If the target plasmid was not present, the gRNAs would bind to the decoy binding sites and inhibit transcription of the programmable cell death gene.This summer, we fully designed the construct including the gRNAs, dCas9 scaffolding, multiple programmable cell death genes, and the decoy binding site construct.For further information on the extent of collaboration, read below.The original objective in designing a PCR machine was to design the kind of machine that anyone could look at the parts list for, buy whatever was needed online, and assemble it themselves according to a publicly designed blueprint.This was the basis of our comparison.The E lysis gene was the only cell death part that convincingly showed that it killed bacteria to a significant degree.It could be that the lysis protein is less effective when it is not expressed in tandem with the other two components of the operon it comes from.Going forward, we would like to actually incorporate our cell death genes into the overall construct.Each functional element of the PCR machine can be reduced to a simple circuit diagram, which is hand drawn below.Printed details can be crudely seen below.The only part salvaged from the old 1994 thermal cycler found in surplus was the heating block, whose design has not changed.The first design was a completely disorganized mess of temporarily attached cables and individual components that all needed to be tested.Our work over the summer fed into three main projects: a gene circuit to detect antibiotic resistance, a review of programmable cell deaths and the creation of a $100 thermocycler.With the goal of combating antibiotic resistance in mind, the most practical function for the \u0093then\u0094 statement to perform is to initiate cell death.Several different such programmable cell death genes were tested to compare how well they killed the bacteria so that the best candidate could be determined and implemented in the final construct.This can be accomplished with a couple of 10W 10? power resistors in series, or even a couple 100W 1? power resistors in parallel (The fundamental idea of our project is to create an IF gate - if a certain genetic sequence is present on the target plasmid, transcribe a different gene.Once each part of the machine was deemed suitable for incorporation into a more portable, permanent housing, the next phase of prototyping began.The goal of this design was to incorporate all the above components into a single compact and portable case.This would allow for the decoy sites to hairpin and the programmable cell death gene to be transcribed.They were calibrated by the Steinhart-Hart equation, which goes as follows:Where A, B, and C are constants unique to each thermistor that can be calculated as a system of equations by taking the resistance of the thermistor at three different and known temperatures.The brains behind the machine is the Arduino board, which is responsible for processing the current temperature of the heating block and telling the H-Bridge which direction to send the current to get the heating block to the desired temperature.Thank you to Ben\u0092s dad, Patrick Hoover, for being able to find and acquire miscellaneous screws and capacitors and tools needed to assemble the prototypes.The target plasmid must also have a high copy number in comparison to the dCas9 plasmid.We decided to use multiple gRNAs in order to fully repress the gene.Also, the shield has a safety to shut down all current when it senses potentially overheating.Therefore, the first thing to fix is to try and bypass the faulty and frustratingly fickle Motor Shield with a self-built H-Bridge incorporating real high current relays.With this foreknowledge, we went ahead and bought the TEC1-12709 model which is rated at 90W and can handle a maximum current of 9A (note: the openPCR project used a custom built Peltier chip that could handle a maximum of 86W and 7.8A.For a unit rated at 14A, this is incredibly frustrating.The Shoebox Design was a long-lived, frustrating phase of the prototyping process.These target sequences must be preceded by a Protospace Adjacent Motif (PAM) which is required for the dCas9 to land.At higher levels induction, the cell death genes are expressed more and killing the cells more, so the optical density should be lower.The protein is derived from the genome of a bacteriophage, whose sole purpose is to infect bacteria, have them produce many new phages, and then make them lyse in order to release the reproduced phages.It failed to output a full 12V when the current was desired to flow in a counter-clockwise direction.At a given level of induction, the greater the difference between the induced and uninduced samples, the more effective the gene is at killing cells.An aluminum heat sink was attached to the VNH2SP30 chips and another fan incorporated to try and keep the motor shield cool, but even this is insufficient for how hot those chips get.We will be the first to admit that this design is still incredibly much a prototype.The gRNA sequences were the reverse compliments of the gene segments we targeted.Once we designed our gRNAs, we wanted to create the IF gate rather than just using dCas9 to repress the Kanamycin resistance gene.Additional research should also be done on mechanisms by which any or all of the antimicrobial peptides can be transported from the inside of the cell to the outside of the cell.The first H-Bridge bought was an old L293D Arduino motor shield, capable of running the native voltage of the board (5V) and outputting 600mA per motor (max of 4 motors).However, we were never able to fully assemble the construct, and therefore do not have any definitive results on the effectiveness of the IF gate.When plugged in to just the computer power supply, this new chip was drawing currents around 5A and heating a heating block twice as large as itself to 95\u00b0C in less than 1 min.If the target plasmid was present, the gRNAs would attach to and deactivate the Kanamycin resistance gene on the target plasmid due to the relative high copy number of the target plasmid.This lysis must be initiated from the inside of the cell in order for this whole mechanism to work.However, this proved to be more difficult than anticipated, as we had lot of trouble finding genes in the registry that would kill E. coli.The other cell death parts did not show an appreciable difference between the induced and uninduced samples.Six genes in total were examined, two of which already existed in the registry of standard biological parts, one of which another lab at Duke shared with us, and three of which we designed based on further research.Each of these genes is discussed further below.The original goal with these cell death parts was to adopt several cell death genes from the registry of standard biological parts and further characterize them by comparing their bacteriocidal capability.The first component that needed to be calibrated was the thermistor.Smaller thermistors should be bought and multiple should be embedded into the heating block and the temperatures of each averaged to receive a more accurate temperature of the whole block.However, the peptides are being made within the bacterium and thus have a very hard time accessing the lipopolysaccharides on the outside.The item was soon shipped and basic code implemented allowing the Arduino to control the voltage and direction of current through the PCR.This Monster Motor Shield appeared at first to work great, as code was being tested to cycle through lower simulation temperatures continuously.The one limiting factor in the success of the PCR machine is the Motor Shield.A review of programmable cell deaths produced a strong response from the Phi X 174 (K1835500), however Protegrin-I (K628000) could not be proven to inhibit cell growth from within the cell but further testing is required.Therefore, this chip has the power needed to conduct PCRs.A Peltier chip\u0092s function is quite simple \u0096 it heats up rapidly by stealing heat from the other side of the chip when current is sent through one way, and cools down rapidly when that current direction is reversed.After mounting the power supply to one side of the toolbox to maximize airflow in the case of a closed lid, the rest of the components were placed in a manner to balance the weight of the power supply without losing too much function.The fact that the protein inhibits the production of the cell wall works under this logic.We used the same binding sites that we chose for the gRNAs to target and put them between the report promoter and the ribosomal binding site (RBS) on the dCas9 plasmid.The component responsible for controlling the direction of the current is an H-Bridge, which is very simply a parallel arrangement of four switches.A thermistor or thermocouple is required to monitor the temperature of the heating block.Behind the heating and cooling of the PCR tube well (called \u0093heating block\u0094) is a Peltier chip.Sadly, we were not able to collect temperature over time data during the phase it was working.Going forward, we hope to test the effective of the decoy hairpinning on transcription in isolation and in the overall antibiotic resistance circuit.Thus, one easy project that can be done in the future is to perform a hemolytic assay with CDP to see if, like CDT, its activity against human erythrocytes is abolished while its activity against bacteria is maintained.If the sequence is not present on the target plasmid, do not.The design of the antibiotic resistance detector was began but because of cloning problems was not finished.Once faster and more reliable heating is achieved, the code should be modified to enable fine controls such as controlling the ramp up rate and preventing excess overshoot of the desired temperature.We chose sites at toward the beginning of the Kanamycin resistance gene, as earlier sites more effectively bind and inhibit the gene.Right after assembling all the components into the toolbox, the heating block heated up to 95\u00b0C slowly but surely.The cheaper Arduino Uno R3 would be more than sufficient for the machine.We fear that assembling the H-Bridge into the toolbox has damaged it in some way, but have no way to test the voltage or current measurement.Previous research has been done into the hemolytic and antibiotic abilities of cysteine-deleted tachyplesin, but there has only been investigation into cysteine-deleted protegrin\u0092s antibiotic activity, and not its tendency to lyse human erythrocytes.We decided to use this circuit to tackle the issue of antibiotic resistance: if an antibiotic resistance gene (in our construct, we used Kanamycin resistance) is present in a plasmid, transcribe a programmable cell death gene to kill the cell.A heating lid should eventually be added so that condensation does not appear on the PCR tubes.Thus, thoroughly characterizing the activity of the existing parts as well as the new parts became a main goal for us.With that in mind, producing just the antimicrobial peptides without an export mechanism would be expected to have very little antimicrobial activity.After bringing the machine to college, where tools such as multimeters and oscilloscopes and soldering irons are reserved for classroom labs, the heating block refuses to cycle to 95\u00b0C.There are also a couple of things that can be done in reference to the antimicrobial peptides.However, the RBS must be exposed in order to translate the reporter protein.This should solve both the current limiting problem and overheating safety shut off problem of the Motor Shield.In the last week, we discovered that the website lied about the practical current use.Closing two switches causes the voltage from the DC power source to be defined one way while closing the other two switches causes the voltage to be switched.That would simply tell us that the construct is detecting the specific sequence by fluorescing.", "design": "The following image is our intended final construct.", "human_practice": "We talked at length about the dangers it could produce, like superviruses, \"designer babies,\" GMOs that reduce biodiversity, etc.In the syllabus you and the team developed, the students were supposed to come up with a project proposal of sorts, do you mind sharing a few of the ideas they had?Gene therapy for disease: Up-regulating MEF2C, a neurological developmental gene that is dangerously down-regulated in some HIV/AIDS patients.Designing bacteria to remove arsenic that is in dangerous levels in wine or polluted drinking waterDental treatment involving the application of engineered viruses to cripple plaque-causing bacteriaWhat\u0092s really encouraging about these projects is that students are thinking of ways to implement synthetic biology, not as a laboratory curiosity, but as a tangible means to improve lives.The public however, often adopts an \u0093all or nothing\u0094 approach to addressing these issues; either eschew all genetic work or to allow all genetic work regardless of the ethics.Lastly, we worked on a \u0093DIY\u0094 PCR machine; do you think that this sort of \u0093garage biology\u0094 poses a safety concern?I don\u0092t think people appreciate how much work it takes to run a lab and to get some DNA manipulation to perform properly.Discussion grew to include the current research being done, potential applications, and the ethical implications of such technology.An interview with student instructor and Duke iGEM\u0092s former president, Matt Farnitano:So, to kick things off, there isn\u0092t a consensus on what synthetic biology precisely entails, as the field is still in development.From a teacher\u0092s perspective, what insights into the workings of synthetic biology did we gain?As a team in iGEM, we have a somewhat narrowed view of synthetic biology.We set out to provide students with the ability to discuss and evaluate synthetic biology, but they delivered new ideas which they themselves, or an iGEM team, could pursue.Teaching the course gave a more comprehensive appreciation for the scope of the field as a whole.The largest misconception or disconnect which is apparent in those new to synthetic biology seems to be the disparity in what could potentially be done, and what can realistically be done.We learn and implement techniques and knowledge which is relevant to the work we do, but synthetic biology encompasses far more than a single project can, and as such, focusing solely on a project can result in a lack of peripheral vision.What sort of attitude or reservedness towards synthetic biology\u0092s capabilities prevailed?Actually, all of our students were pretty open minded about the subject in general, and were interested in finding out what our current capabilities as far as DNA manipulation go.That said, the futurist argument returns; maybe in the future, garage biology will become an issue, but that\u0092s also why we need some sort of regulatory conference to be held early on in synthetic biology\u0092s life.There is a perception that the ability to manipulate DNA will give us near instantaneous access to all aspects of life, whether it\u0092s creating designer babies or producing a new GMO crop, but an iGEM team can attest, the distance between DNA manipulation and a desired result is not insignificant.I think what\u0092s notable is that no one in the class had any prior experience with iGEM or with synthetic biology.From a social standpoint, it is a tool to advance society both scientifically, and to explore new ethical questions from a futurist standpoint, that is to say, to explore the future\u0092s potential.What sort of students did you have in the class; more specifically, what sort of majors or interests did they have?We mostly had people with backgrounds in science or engineering enroll, but we also had a few humanities majors to balance it out.Creating Life: Teaching the Ethical and Policy Issues in the Emergence of Synthetic Biology.To provide students with foundational knowledge so they can critically evaluate the potential for synthetic biologyWe created a house course to teach differing aspects of synthetic biology to Duke University undergraduates.People don\u0092t really appreciate how difficult it can be to produce a result via genetic manipulation.Ethics and regulation may not be able to keep up with synthetic biology discoveries ex post facto, which could be dangerous with regards to certain aspects, such as bioterrorism or modifying the humans.For the purposes of the class, how did you define synthetic biology?Sure, we actually spent the first few sessions debating the \u0093definition\u0094 of synthetic biology.", "modeling": "From average duration of DNA binding events, the rate of dissociation was found to be 0.01 per minute for a complete match and up to 10 for an unspecific match 1.With a slightly less matched reporter sequence, the response was more sensitive but with even less matching, the amount of repression in the absence of target goes up.From this the effect of different starting concentrations of dCas9 is shown on the amount of repression for different copy numbers of target plasmids.Thus, with too much dCas9 the repression of the reporter gene in the presence of the target becomes too high.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "The BsaI will cut itself out of the sequence, as shown in the picture below:  After cutting its recognition sequence out and leaving the desired overhang, a gRNA with matching sticky ends can be inserted into the space.BbsI is then used to snip out the gRNA to prepare for combining with more gRNAs in Golden Gate Assembly.In other words, the gRNA will completely take the place of the BsaI restriction site.The BbsI Restriction site can be added via PCR in order to create custom matching sticky ends to string multiple gRNAs in a row.Each plasmid consisted of the R0011 pLac promoter, B0034 ribosome binding site and the programmable cell death part on pSB1C3 Each were verified by Sanger sequencing.The colonies were allowed to grow for 15 minute then 1mM IPTG was established in the experimental colonies.BsaI is a restriction enzyme with unique type 2 properties.The cells were then diluted to an optical density of approximately 0.2.", "result": "The test for the E Lysis gene showed the cell growth inhibition is statistically significant.Production on the inside of the cell may not effectively lyse cells.However, the protegrin and tachyplesin reading could not be proven to inhibit growth.", "safety": "bacteria which possess antibiotic resistance), potentially bypassing the growing antibiotic resistance problemsHowever, the potential exists for someone to modify the gene circuit to remove healthy cells or to kill human cellsGiven that the method for \u0093removing\u0094 individuals is lysis, this would result in exogenous genetic material, which if left without nuclease activity, could be transformed into another cellIf benign bacteria with antibiotic resistance were to pick up this material, they might be adversely affected by the gene, which could detriment microbiomesThe project, in its current state, is still in a proof-of-concept stage, and as such, poses few safety threats, but if it were to be modified for use in other more pathogenic bacteria, cancer cells, or viruses, we would need to consider more precautions for future developmentAny long term applications in microbial populations within humans should place safety as the primary concern.Care should also be taken to avoid any pathogenicity that could arise from the added plasmid and cell death gene.Initially, we tested Protegrin I for antibacterial properties, and for use as a potential \u0093kill switch\u0094 to be implemented in the main project However, Protegrin I has hemolytic properties, and as such, would have been unfit for use on humans or on model organisms like miceLiterature suggests that removing cysteine residues can disrupt disulfide bridge formation in the protein, reducing hemolytic capacity, but still maintaining broad spectrum antibacterial activity [2]In order to improve the safety of using Protegrin I in future antibacterial studies, we developed a biobrick which essentially is Protegrin I minus four cysteine residuesHowever, the hemolytic capacity of the biobricked form of Protegrin I is untested, and will require verification in order to determine its \u0093safety\u0094 towards humansWe intend to mark initial trials with fluorescent proteins in order to easily isolate the effect of the circuit on transcription but then to extend the effect to the study of population growth patterns.We used DH5-? strain of E. Coli, which has poor pathogenicity owing to its lack of genes coding for invasion, adhesion, enterotoxins, as well as long-chain lipopolysacharidesStudies show that this strain is unlikely to survive in mouse guts, and therefore, pathogenicity towards humans is unlikely [1]Worked exclusively with Risk Group 1 organisms, as per iGEM regulations, in a Biosafety Level 2 laboratory with well-defined protocols for disposal of chemical and biological wasteEach team member took the Duke University safety courses in lab safety and biohazard safety; a link to policy overviews can be found here.Included general lab procedures such as use of PPE, sharps, fume hoods, proper chemical and biological waste disposal, as well as emergency proceduresWhenever potentially noxious chemicals are handled, they are done so in a chemical fume hood erring on the side of caution and gloves are changed immediately after handling potentially harmful chemicals such as Ethidium BromideThe use of bacteria which possess antibiotic resistance (even if only to ampicillin or chloramphenicol) pose a potential environmental riskIf genes coding for resistance were passed to or picked up by pathogenic species of bacteria, the potential for danger arises, which is why we took precautions to ensure that bacteria were safely disposed ofOur project, if studied to completion, might provide a way to parse through a population and remove undesirable individuals (i.e.We envision a system where the introduction neutral stimulus could produce a negative pressure on bacteria with antibiotic resistance via activation of a programmable cell death gene.Further, the long term successful implementation would work on a largely population level, so the spread of the antibiotic detecting plasmid would be important to the overall phenotypic change away from antibiotic resistance.However, we have chosen to showcase this construct in the context of a pressing problem in medicine: antibiotic resistance.", "keywords": "Xochimilco formaldehyde Sclerotite temperature components hydrolysis saccharification post-staining resistance expression", "track": "Foundational Advance", "part_favorite": "", "part_normal": "BBa_K1835000\nBBa_K1835500\nBBa_K1835501\nBBa_K1835502", "theme": "46", "hits": 0}, "highlight": {"result": [" cells.However, the <font color='#f35762'><b>protegrin</b></font> and tachyplesin reading could not be <font color='#f35762'><b>proven</b></font> to inhibit growth."], "safety": [" <font color='#f35762'><b>protein</b></font>, reducing hemolytic capacity, but still maintaining broad spectrum", " fluorescent <font color='#f35762'><b>proteins</b></font> in order to easily isolate the effect of the circuit on transcription", " plasmid and cell death gene.Initially, we tested <font color='#f35762'><b>Protegrin</b></font> I for antibacterial", " main project However, <font color='#f35762'><b>Protegrin</b></font> I has hemolytic properties, and as such, would have", " antibacterial activity [2]In order to improve the safety of using <font color='#f35762'><b>Protegrin</b></font> I in"], "attribution": [" as offering insights into the uses of Cas9 <font color='#f35762'><b>protein</b></font> technologies.Dr.Lingchong You", " not have done it without you.

above to make L. lactis NZ9000 a better chassis in synthetic biology.(Figure 1) Figure 1 Classic chassis used in synthetic biology Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are a group of Gram positive, non-sporulating bacteria that include microorganisms from different genuses such as Leuconostoc, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Pedicoccus, and Streptococcus.Among them, the NICE system is the most widely used protein expression system for L. lactis.Figure 3 The nisin controlled expression (NICE) system However, few efforts have been made to improve L. lactis NZ9000 to be a better synthetic biology chassis.In the iGEM competition, the 2014 Groningen University- Netherlands team engineered L. lactis to detect burn wound bacteria pathogens S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and to secret antimicrobial peptides and biofilm-dissolving proteins to fight against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa infections at the site of burn wounds.In synthetic biology and the iGEM competition, scientists and iGEMers are familiar with the concept of chassis, the conceptual extension of a living cell, including Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and so on.Over the past decade, there has been an increasing interest in the use of LAB as a synthetic biology chassis.L. lactis has also become famous as the first genetically modified organism to be used alive for the treatment of human disease (Recombinant L. lactis secreting IL-10 for the treatment of Crohn disease, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00729872).L. lactis is the first LAB whose genome was fully sequenced.lactis is one of the best characterized LAB with detailed knowledge on genetics, metabolism, and biodiversity.The molecular biology workhorse, E. coli, is an ideal chassis in synthetic biology owing to our deep understanding of its biologic characteristics, its convenience of genetic manipulation and the relatively a large number of well-studied gene regulatory systems.In 2013, Uppsala-Sweden team designed and tested many promoters, reporter genes, vectors, toxin-antitoxin systems, and signal peptides to make Lactobacillus new probiotic chassis in synthetic biology.Many contemporary synthetic biology researches rely on the use of bacterial or eukaryotic chassis for plugging-in and plugging-out genetic circuits and new-to-nature functionalities.It is easy to be manipulated with many cloning and expression tools, including the nisin controlled expression (NICE) system, the Cre-lox system, the single stranded DNA recombineering method and so on.The integration of the nisKR genes downstream of the pepN gene of the international prototype MG1363 yielded the L. lactis NZ9000 strain.LAB have been classified as food grade microorganisms, which are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) organisms by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and fulfill criteria of the qualified presumption of safety (QPS) according to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).(Figure 3) It is based on the control of strong nisin inducible promoters (PnisA or PnisZ) and the cognate signal transduction NisKR two-component system.Since then, L. lactis NZ9000 has been distributed to laboratories worldwide and has become the \u0093laboratory workhorse\u0094 for protein expression and has been used in many physiological studies.Secondly, because the NICE system inducer nisin is also a food grade antibacterial peptide, the intolerance of NZ9000 to high levels of nisin concentration compromises the gene expression efficiency.(Figure 2) In iGEM, several teams have tried to ameliorate LAB to be new chassis in synthetic biology.L. lactis has once been named the official state microbe of Wisconsin, the number one cheese-producing state in the United States.From physiology to systems metabolic engineering for the production of biochemicals by lactic acid bacteria.Thus, the host of many productions has been switched from E. coli to S. cerevisiae, such as the anti-malaria drug, semi-synthetic artemisinin.However, the opportunistic pathogen nature of E. coli, the lipopolysaccarides (LPS) contamination, and the intolerance to physicochemical stress and harsh operating conditions hinder it to be an ideal choice for industrial application.In addition to its traditional use in food fermentations, L. lactis has increasingly been used in modern biotechnological applications, including cancer, diabetes, vaccination, infection protection and animal diseases.LAB do not contain LPS attached to the cell membrane.It is used to ferment a range of raw materials, such as milk, which is used to produce cheese (species of Lactococcus) and yoghurt (species of Streptococcus and Lactobacillus).The 2015 Utah State University-USA team created phage resistant L. lactis by integrating reporter system and kill switch that can be applied in cheese industry.Lactococcus lactis was used to create a smart bandage that can heal burn wound and fight against bacterial infections (Groningen University- Netherlands, 2014).For instance, in therapeutics, LAB are used as live delivery vehicles for DNA, peptides, single-chain antibody fragments (ScFvs), antigens, cytokines, enzymes and allergens to treat or prevent infectious diseases, cancer, gastrointestinal tract (GIT) diseases, diabetes, and so on.It is therefore not surprising that E. coli has dominated in the iGEM competition.", "description": "We also clarified a part BBa_K1830002 created by the iGEM15_Concordia Group.During the experiment, we utilized and verified a part BBa_K1654007 created by the iGEM15_IIT_Madras Group.", "design": "", "human_practice": "Before we started in the wet lab, we asked Doctor Li to evaluate the biosafety issues of our whole project.Hopefully, this coloring book will be a carrier of the spirit of scientific research and our wish to bring benefits to the world.We have brought our coloring book to the Giant Jamboree, hoping that all of you could have fun with it and know more about us.During the meeting, NUDT-China introduced the iGEM process, and shared their experience in team building in detail with us.It was nice to see that we did a good job in presentation and the audience was attracted by our project.At the same time, they gave comments on our project, and put forward a lot of good ideas.Drawing itself is relaxing and thought-inspiring, and in the form of drawing, we presented our work and popularized iGEM.He told us that with the advent of the information age, acquiring knowledge and exchanging information had become much easier than decades ago, with iGEM as a good example of integration of network information and international communication.At the same time, we found our mathematical modeling unsatisfactory, so we invited their talented group members to provide technical guidance for us.Thanks to her guidance, we had a better understanding of antibiotic resistance and we were enlightened to do more.SCU-China:The project of SCU-China focused on the antibacterial deodorant insole.Meanwhile, we have just received a meet-up invitation from the Southwest Union (iGEM meet-up in southwest China).He helped us analyze whether there were potential transposable elements among the His targeting locus, and the result proved to be negative, which meant the device integrated into the His locus would not be horizontally transferred to other bacteria.We also want to discuss with the organizers of iGEM abut the perspective of publishing the coloring book, so that the spirit of iGEM could be spread out and keep encouraging more iGEMers to devote their talent and passion.TMMU-China Meet-up:After several attendances of meet-ups, we hold a meeting one month before the opening ceremony.UESTC-China: The UESTC-China post some plasmids and introduced to us some details about the iGEM.Together with the SCU-China, UESTC-China, UESTC-software and SICAU-China, we knew much detailed information about the competition, such as the progress and the judging criteria.To know about the exact situation of antibiotic resistance in the hospital, we visited Doctor Gong Yali, who works at the burn department in the Southwest Hospital.Interestingly, we were lucky to have dinner with two former iGEMers Zhang Haoqian and Liu Yang, who encouraged us to go deeper in research and promote iGEM and synthetic biology research in our university.The biosafety issue is one of the major concerns of both participant teams and organizers of iGEM.He hoped that given the chance, all the young adults could seize the moment to learn more, not for medals or awards, but to stand on the frontier of the age, and by working together, we would make a difference.From the CCiC, we were aware of our current disadvantages in quantitative measurement and the overall logic, which laid a foundation for the later adjustments and improvements.In our coloring book, we simplified several important scientific items into simple stick figures, including DNA chains, viruses, bacteriophages, bacteria, so that people would understand some basic concepts of synthetic biology by painting them.Therefore, using our advantages, we helped them verify the antimicrobial effect of the insole.CCiC Conference:As the competition approaches, the Central China iGEM Consortium (CCiC) conference was hosted by Sun Yat-sen University, in order to simulate the iGEM Giant jamboree and enhance further communication among different teams.It is worth mentioning that with only one month from the competition, many teams felt they were under great pressure.We were inspired by the recently popular coloring book Secret Garden, and we learnt from its design.To our delight, the public were in favor of color painting and they praised our activity for being a good chance to broaden their horizons.Additionally, considering that we had several models, we hoped to achieve visualization of the models by using software.The most important thing to us was that we harvested much useful advice from the judges, mentors and students.All the teams exchanged suggestions with each other and build up deep friendship.This was a great opportunity to present our work and learn from the other 28 teams.Antibiotic resistance is the ability of bacteria to resist the effects of antibiotics.\"Human Practice is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work.\"UESTC-software kindly helped us, and the result was satisfying and helpful for our further work.For example, one of her researches demonstrated that the Acinetobacter baumannii was resistant to many antibiotics.Due to the abuse of antibiotics, multidrug resistant bacteria have emerged and posed great threat to public health, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and so on.As a new team, with limited knowledge of iGEM competition, we desperately needed instructions and suggestions on how to start and manage a team.Although small in scale, this meet-up aimed at further promoting projects and better preparing for the whole competition.In order to spread the fun and attractiveness of synthetic biology, we designed a coloring book.At last, the exciting hot pot dinner lighted up the happy atmosphere for every team member to enjoy the meeting and refresh for future challenges.She agreed with our idea and praised us for concerning antibiotics resistance.She compared the counter selection with our visual selection system and discussed with us about their value, on the basis of which she gave her advice.", "modeling": "Here, we try to combine the 3 models together to get a compound model to calculate the total protein level that can be surface displayed at the community level.Figure 4.1 Schematic representation of the total protein level at the community level.We combined the best growth curve and the gene expression rate, using matlab to realize our idea by programming.We found that when the concentration of nisin is 1 IU, the efficiency of protein expression level that can reach a peak is better than other nisin concentrations.This combined model can be used in the nisin controlled expression system, and reduce the workload of researchers.Figure 4.2 The total protein expression level under different nisin concentrations.However, it is still difficult to directly determine whether our products are produced sufficiently, and to evaluate the total expression amount at the community level.In order to predict the protein expression rate and amount under different nisin concentrations, we treated the bacteria in isolation, which means at the single cell level.The theory basis of this model (including 4 steps) was supplemented in the note.As shown in Figure 3.2, we found that the non-parametric model can predict the process of bacteria growth rate very well, and the nisin antibacterial activity is enhanced as the concentration increased.Coefficient k was got by the experimental result.Table 2 Definition of symbols used in the Michaelis-Mentin kineticsUsing the model we established, we predict the protein production rate under different nisin concentrations as shown in Figureure 1.1.The value of was determined by reference (Lin et al., 2016), the definition of symbols are listed in Table 3.Table 3 Definition of symbols used in the recursion equationUsing the secretion model, we found that 89.46% of the expressed protein will be secreted and anchored to the cell, when the expression of protein is stable as shown in Figure 2.The result is similar to several reported protein secretion ratio with the signal peptide SPusp45 (87%(Lin et al., 2016), 89%(Borrero et al., 2011) ).Figure 2 The amount of secreted proteins (yellow) and the total expressed proteins (blue)[1]Szymanska, Z., Parisot, M., and Lachowicz, M. (2014).The higher concentrations of nisin will lead to higher expression levels of protein of interest.Figure 1.1 Simulated protein production levels under different nisin conditionsTo test whether our model can be applied to the real situation, we compared the expression levels of mCherry proteins and the simulated results.We retrieved the data (Table 1) to get a fitting equation, which will be used in the protein production model.The log-sigmoid function was used to fit, because the nisin receptors on the cell membrane is limited, and this function value will not continue to increase as x reach to a certain value.In model 3, we used non-parametric method to predict the growth rate of bacteria at the community level.We also optimized the nisin controlled expression (NICE) system, the protein surface display system.In the NICE system, the PnisZ or PnisA promoter controlled gene expression rate depends on the concentration of nisin.J Theor Biol 363, 118-128.Model 4: The total protein level at the community levelIn model 1, we treated bacteria at the single cell level.A low concentration of nisin will lead to a low expression of the target protein.In our project, we used the signal peptide SPusp45 to direct protein secretion and the cA domain to make proteins surface displayed.In model 2, we predict the secretion and surface display efficiency of proteins base on the SPusp45 secretion signal peptide and cA anchoring domain.In the NICE system, nisin was used as the food grade gene expression inducer.As shown in Figureure 1.2, the two curves are well matched.Figure 1.2 The fluorescence intensity levels produced by mCherry proteins along with the simulated protein levels under different concentrations of nisin.In this section, we try to simulate the secretion process in bacteria, and predict the amount of protein can be surface displayed at a given time.A recursion equation was used to calculate the amount of protein that on the cell wall.This is suit for the characteristics of our promoter.In the NICE system, the protein of interest production process is shown as below?We tried to use Michaelis-Mentin kinetics to predict the protein production rate.We made several modifications on the equation to accommodate the transcriptional regulatory mode of the PnisZ promoter.Attention?We replaced [PnisZ] in the Michaelis-Mentin kinetics by F(X) that we obtain by fitting, and we try to transform this typical math model to describe the direct proportion relationship between [PnisZ] and the concentrate of extracellular nisin.In one research, the quantitative relationship between the extracellular concentrations of nisin and the efficiency of PnisZ were measured (Guo et al., 2013).The results were obtained by only 3 groups of experimental data, indicating that this model can get the credible results by a smaller amount of data.Figure 3.2 Simulated bacteria growth rate of L. lactis under different nisin concentrations.This prediction will be incorporated into the equation to calculate the total protein amount at the community level.Functional analysis and randomization of the nisin-inducible promoter for tuning gene expression in Lactococcus lactis.Many growth models have been proposed, such as the widely used Logistics model.Mathematical modeling of the intracellular protein dynamics: the importance of active transport along microtubules.Mathematical modeling of the intracellular protein dynamics: the importance of active transport along microtubules.Use of the usp45 lactococcal secretion signal sequence to drive the secretion and functional expression of enterococcal bacteriocins in Lactococcus lactis.The theory basis of this model (including 4 steps) was supplemented in the note.However, when primary models are applied to bacterial growth curves, the biological variability is reduced to a single curve defined by some kinetic parameters (lag time and growth rate), and sometimes the models give poor fits in some regions of the curve.Moreover, the number of experiment is usually limited for most iGEM teams (relative to the threshold to get credible growth curve).To resolve the dilemma we incorporated the nisin immunity or resistant genes nisI or nsr into the NICE system.And we collaborated with UESTC who helped us to post a visual interface of our model results on the web page.Nature 428, 437-441.To be surface displayed, proteins should be secreted after translation and then anchored to the cell wall, which is really a long journey.However, a high concentration of nisin will inhibit the growth of bacteria, which will also decrease the total expression level.We try to predict the gene expression rate under different nisin concentrations.", "notebook": "Therefore, we sought advice from other teams and meanwhile helped them in some ways.February 22nd UESTC-China: They introduced iGEM to us and invited us to participate in it.March 12th NUDT-China: They guided us in terms of team construction, and introduced the rules of the iGEM, which inspired us.June 11th Nanjing-China: While designing the project, we encountered some problems.After communication with Nanjing-China, they gave us useful advice and helped us to re-group our thoughts in our project design.August 5th SCU-China: In the Southwest Union, we knew that the team of Sichuan University had difficulties in verifying the efficiency of an antibacterial peptide.Team registration was completed.April: Team members consulted literature and brainstormed to discuss problems in the project and team constrcution, and set the project as \"promote Lactococcus lactis to be a better chassis in synthetic biology\".May: Instructed by our mentors, we designed the markerless integration visual selection system for Lactococcus Lactis, Then we ordered primers, and started experiments.June: The NZ-blue strain was constructed and the utility of it was tested.July: We completed the optimizations of the system, and constructed the plasmid containing the promoter PnisZ and nisin resistance gene nsr.At the same time, we invited their members in charge of modeling to provide technical guidance for us.September 27th UESTC-software: In the Southwest Union, UESTC-software brought up with some problems in designing DNA sequencing primers, so we helped them to design the primers they needed.So we helped them in the verification.After building up our own team and during the process of completing our project, we found our weaknesses in many aspects.", "protocol": "", "result": "We also clarified a part BBa_K1830002 created by the iGEM15_Concordia Group.During the experiment, we utilized and verified a part BBa_K1654007 created by the iGEM15_IIT_Madras Group.", "safety": "Without histidine supplement in the culture, the His locus targeted device knocked in recombinant L. lactis can only be replicated in the lab.A similar biological containment strategy has been applied to the IL-10 recombinant L. lactis using the thyA locus.By this way, the recombinant L. lactis strains are biologically contained in the lab.The pNisZ promoter sequences, the lacZ gene we utilized, the nisI gene, the nsr gene and other DNA fragments we used in this study are derived from other GRAS organisms.Another biosafety issue we considered and resolved in our project is the antibiotic resistant genes.The His locus disrupted recombinant L. lactis strains can not survive in the wild for histine is very limited in the environment.In our design, the recombinant L. lactis is devoid of any antibiotic resistant genes.What is more, the His locus is required for the biosynthesis of histidine which is essential for the growth of L. lactis.A recombinant L. lactis expressing the IL-10 to treat Crohn disease has been approved by the USA FDA.To reduce the potential risk of releasing nisin into the environment to influence ecological niches, the nisin supplemented culture medium is heated, and the nisin is denatured and antibacterial activity is lost.Horizontal gene transfer possibilities and biological containmentThe genome integrated DNA fragments are localized at the His locus.A complete understanding of experimental risks associated with synthetic biology is helping to enforce the knowledge and effectiveness of biosafety.Scientist that favor the development of synthetic biology claim that the use of biosafety mechanisms such as suicide genes and nutrient dependencies will ensure the organisms cannot survive outside of the lab setting in which they were originally created.Furthermore, we received one week biosafety training in the lab.The thyA locus is required for the synthesis of thymidine, which is also essential for the growth of L. lactis.Biosafety training and protection actions in the labThe experiments are mainly performed at the molecular level.Some biosafety risks may be caused by the reagents we used.Biosafety is the prevention of large-scale loss of biological integrity, focusing both on ecology and human health.The Vi antigen locus DNA fragment was produced using PCR, taking the S.Typhi genomic DNA as the template.In the lab, the supplemented antibiotics in culture medium such as ampicillin and erymycin are strictly treated according to the rules in the lab.Professor Yanguang Cong kindly provided us with the genomic DNA of a virulence attenuated S.Typhi vaccine, Ty21a.We didn\u0092t culture S.thphi in the lab.Complete genome sequence of the prototype lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis subsp.E. coli is the most studied and utilized bacteria in synthetic biology.Kill switches were also actively developed to secure biosafety in synthetic biology.The organisms we are dealing with are L. lactis, and E. coli DH5?.We learned how to operate the UV light-equipped biosafety hood and the high pressure vapour sterilizer.These prevention mechanisms include conduction of regular reviews of the biosafety in laboratory settings, as well as strict guidelines to follow.High security facilities are necessary when working with Synthetic Biology as there are possibilities of bioterrorism acts or release of harmful chemicals and or organisms into the environment.Due to the overuse and inappropriate application of antibiotics in medical treatment, in animal farming and other practices, multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria have rapidly evolved.", "keywords": "fluorescence penicillin crescentus indigoidine StarScaffold nanoparticles formaldehyde polysilicate rhamnolipids respiratory", "track":

purification kit\u0094.", "background": "", "description": "As a result, the Spycatcher in the fusion protein is anchored in the Magnetosome, which can be isolated from AMB-1 bacterial through sonication and centrifugation.Thus, a protein of interest can be expressed on the Magnetosome when fused with Mms13.Due to covalent linkage, stringent washing can be used to achieve high purity of the recombinant protein that is subsequently released by cleavage of a designated protease.Overall, our novel approach for protein purification is reliable and highly specific.Overlay the polymerized separating gel (10% or 16%, or 16%/6 M urea) directly with a 4% sample (stacking) gel prepared as indicated in the table in Step 1, except if resolution of proteins <5 kDa is desired.Now the isolated magnetosome linked by Spycatcher can be used to specifically bind to the Spytag tagged recombinant protein in bacterial lysate of E. coli.The 16% separating gel and the overlaid 10% \u0091spacer gel\u0092 can be polymerized together if no glycerol is added to the 10% acrylamide gel mixture (the common role of glycerol in SDS gels is to increase the density of solutions and to facilitate gel casting; it has no obvious effect on protein separation).After the final wash, gently resuspend the particles in 100 ?l of MagneGST Binding/Wash Buffer.Note: After being washed and resuspended in the appropriate volume of MagneGST Binding/Wash Buffer, theMagneGST particles can be stored at 4? overnight.The Spycatcher-Mms13-linked Magnetosome can specifically and covalently conjugate to the Spytag-tagged protein in the bacterial lysate and they can be simply co-purified by a magnet.Add 250 ?l of MagneGST Binding/Wash Buffer to the particles, and resuspend by pipetting or inverting.6.To elute DNA, add 50 ?l Buffer EB (10 mM Tris\u00b7Cl, pH 8.5) or water (pH 7.0\u00968.5) to the center of the QIAquick membrane andcentrifuge the column for 1 min.1.Add 250 ?l of MagneGST Binding/Wash Buffer to the particles, and mix gently by pipetting or inverting.Add 250 ?l of MagneGST Binding/Wash Buffer to the particles, and mix gently by pipetting or inverting.Place the tube in the magnetic stand, and allow the MagneGST particles to be captured by the magnet.8.Place the tube in the magnetic stand, and allow the MagneGST particles to be captured by the magnet.6.Place the tube in the magnetic stand, and allow the MagneGST particles to be captured by the magnet.2.Place the tube in the magnetic stand, and allow the MagneGST particles to be captured by the magnet.5.After Spytag and Spycatcher form an irreversible covalent bond via spontaneous isopeptide linkage, they can be brought down together with the Magnetosome in a magnetic field.The following two strategies can be used to circumvent this problem.First, in the design shown above, we can express a TEV protease-Mms13 fusion protein in AMB-1; thus, the TEV protease can be easily removed after it fulfills its task.In the magnetic bacterium AMB-1, Spycatcher-Mms13 fusion protein is expressed and the Mms13 part can tightly associate with the Magnetosome.To pull down the GST protein, add 20 ?l of the blocked bead to each sample in eppendorf tubes.6.In this case, the recombinant protein can be released by DTT(DL-Dithiothreitol)-mediated cleavage.StrainMediumBacteria recoveryBacteria incubationCollect

protein purificationBradford protein assay SDS-PAGEThe Magnetospirillum magneticum strain AMB-1(ATCC 700264) was purchased from ATCC and keep in -80?.For the enrichment of the AMB-1 strain, we use the medium contained the following ingredients:1.Fig.3 Proteins on the Magnetosome\u0092s membrane and AMB-1 modification by transformed with Mms13 protein.If resolution of proteins <5 kDa is desired, then use AB-6 instead of AB-3 for the separating gel and overlay the separating gel with a 1-cm 10% gel, made up as described in the table.Extensive and stringent washing can be applied to remove proteins of nonspecific binding and the protein of interest can be released by cleavage of TEV protease.One caveat in the design above is that the TEV protease is still present in the final elution of the recombinant protein.Add 600 ?l of cell lysate, prepared as described above, to the particles.We generate Spycatcher-Mms13 and express this fusion protein in AMB-1 bacteria to make Spycatcher linked to the Magnetosome.Depending on the requirements of protein detection and analysis, concentration of the sample may be necessary.The maximal protein load can be limited by large amounts of neutral detergent in the sample and by high concentrations of lipid when solubilizing biological membranes.Add 5 volumes of Buffer PB to 1 volume of the PCR sample and mix.2.For isolated mitochondrial membranes (70% protein, 30% lipid), for example, the optimized maximal protein load of sample wells 0.7 \u00d7 5 mm is 20 ?g.Collect Magnetosomes from the bottom of a tube by multifunctional magnetic corpuscle separator which can produce an inhomogeneous magnetic field (see device).To wash, add 0.75 ml Buffer PE to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30\u009660 s.7.To easily release a captured recombinant protein, we add a cleaving site for the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease between the protein of interest and Spytag.Add TEV protease to the rest solution, release protein of interest.For the Bradford protein assay we used Bradford Protein Assay Kit according to manufacturer s instructions.1.Apply 10-?l sample volumes to 0.7 \u00d7 5 mm sample wells.For the optimal resolution of peptides of 1\u00965 kDa, reduce the amount of SDS in the incubation buffers, for example, by fourfold and reduce the volume applied to 5 ?l.We document the characterization of this part in the Part\u0092s and Device\u0092s Registry entry and they can be searched in parts\u0092, human practice\u0092s and results\u0092 pages of our team wiki.The sample volume applied for Tricine\u0096SDS-PAGE should not substantially exceed 10 ?l, because stacking of proteins in the range 20\u0096100 kDa is less efficient than in Laemmli\u0096SDS-PAGE.8.The volume and buffer to be used depend on the origins of the samples.Our method is based on the highly specific recognition and covalent conjugation between Spytag (a peptide with 13 amino acids) and Spycatcher (a peptide with 116 amino acids).Setting the SDS/neutral detergent ratio to <10 may result in a surprising result after staining: normally separated, large proteins may be detected in the upper gel areas, but the lower gel areas may be completely clear with no small proteins detectable.4.Remove the tube from the magnetic stand.Remove the tube from the magnetic stand.Remove the tube from the magnetic stand.The waste solution was empty by releasing the clip at the bottom of the tube, and then used distilled water to wash Magnetosomes, the process was repeated more than three times, and the Magnetosomes were allowed to bind at the side of the tube by magnetic force.Accordingly, the desired protein concentration in the sample is 0.1 mg/ml\u00961 for each protein band.Among them, Mms13 has the highest affinity to the magnetic core, and its anchoring efficiency is also better than other Mms proteins.The final step was turning off the device, using PBS to resuspend Magnetosomes.According to reference, the pulsed magnetic field could enhance Magnetosomes formation.Several proteins are identified to tightly bind to the membrane of Magnetosome, such as MagA, Mms16, and Mms13.We poured crude AMB-1 cell lysate into a tube and switch it on, 220 / 110v alternating current through the rectifier into a 24V DC power, acting on the electromagnet.We also take the advantage of a magnetic bacterium AMB-1 that can produce magnet particles, also called Magnetosome, covered by a bilayer phospholipid membrane, in which Mms13 protein is anchored.(for 500 ml of bacteria culture, use 10 ml of MagneGST Cell Lysis Reagent)3.Incubate the cell suspension at room temperature for 20\u009630 min on a rotating platform or shaker and then sonicate for 1 min.1.Around 0.4% neutral detergent in the sample can be tolerated for direct mixing with SDS-containing sample incubation buffers and application to SDS gels.Freezing cell pellets will increase efficiency of cell lysis of certain strains, such as the

document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year.(Lower temperature and lower IPTG concentration could reduce the formation of inclusion bodies and consequently increase the solubility of the synthesized protein).5.Add IPTG till final concentration of 0.1 mM to 2.0 mM and continue growing for another 3-4 h. Alternatively, the bacteria can also grown at room temperature.4.Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.Our team has been registered, we have had the best

us a lot of inspiration on designing our project.", "protocol": "", "result": "We use intein to replace the TEV site, which can be cleaved by DTT.In order to test the binding rate of Spycatcher and Spytag with different protein molecular weight we constructed 5 vectors successfully: 3\u00d7Z domain, 6\u00d7Z domain, 9\u00d7Z domain, 12\u00d7Z domain, 15\u00d7Z domain respectively.These are our gradient proteins and these parts will be used to test the binding rate of Spytag and Spycatcher with the protein we want to purify with different molecular weight due to the simplicity of adjusting the size of SPA Z domain.We use Electromagnet separator designed by us (see device part) to purify Magnetosome.As the result was shown in Fig.7 a blue pigment signal can be detected on the surface of magnetic beads.Fig.7 Observe the surface of magnetic beads through microscope (400\u00d7)To calculate rate constant, the recombinant vectors that Spytag fused with different molecular weight proteins were transformed into E.coli and induced by IPTG, and then we mix Spytag-protein with Spycatcher in triplicate incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1, 3, 5 or 10 mins, after that we used the SDS-PAGE to test the purification efficiencies.Employing this system, we have expressed proteins with different molecular weights to test their purification efficiencies, and established a mathematic model to represent the correlation between protein molecular weight and incubating time to reach maximal binding of Spycatcher and Spytag.We will optimize medium components and culturing conditions of AMB-1 in order to produce Spycatcher-linked Magnetosomes in an efficient way and then in a large scale.In the following graph (Fig.4), we can find out optimal time for different molecular weights.Fig.4 This graph descirbes the conjugation of Spycatcher and Spytag with incubation time.From the graph, we can find that conjugation of Spycatcher and Spytag increases in proportion to incubation time, which fits with Equation (2).Take 50% as a standard binding rate, we can calculate that Spytag-3\u00d7Z domain, Spytag-6\u00d7Z domain and Spytag-9\u00d7Z domain\u0092s optimal incubation time that are approximately 5, 7.8 and 12.6min, respectively.Obviously, the relationship between protein molecular weight and optimal incubation time is not linear.As a result, equation (1) shows a linear relation between 1/c and t, where c represents the concentration of free Spycatcher.According to the experimental data using Spytag tagged proteins with different molecular weights, we observed that data show a linear relationship fitting the Equation (1).It is listed as below:According to this equation, we can get following additional equations:?\u0097\u0097the binding rate between Spycatcher and SpytagObviously, we can build the correlation between the protein concentration and reaction time.After a series of data transfer and fitting, we can create a graph that mirrors the correlation between molecular weight and incubation time.The interaction between Spycatcher and Spytag should follow the second order reaction kinetics, so we created a differential equation.(STA: 27KD, Spycatcher: 14KD, GST tag: 26KD)Additionally, in order to know whether the Spycatcher, Spytag and blue pigement protein can bind together and localized on the magnetic beads, we used a microscope to detect the blue pigment.Thus, we used the least square fitting to generate the following graphs (Fig.1, 2 and 3) and specific linear equations (Equation 3, 4 and 5).Fig.1 The relationship between 1/c and t of Spytag-3\u00d7Z domain were plotted against time in straight lines.Fig.2 The relationship between 1/c and t of Spytag-6\u00d7Z domain were plotted against time in straight lines.Fig.3 The relationship between 1/c and t of Spytag-9\u00d7Z domain were plotted against time in straight lines.These graphs in Fig.1, 2 and 3 for the relationship between 1/c and t of proteins with different molecular weights were plotted against time in straight lines.To simplify the modeling process, we just take protein molecular weight as a major variable factor because other factors are normally controllable.In this part, our models can not only help determining the relationship between molecular weight and optimal incubation time, but also guide us in prioritizing important factors.In addition, the membrane surrounding the Fe3O4 granules indicates that this purification procedure did not damage the phospholipid bilayer of the Magnetosome.All these results demonstrated that, the culture method using a pulsed magnetic field generator is simple, rapid, continuous, and highly efficient for AMB-1 incubation and large-scale purification of Magnetosome, without break the membrane of Magnetosome.Eleven expression vectors were constructed for genetic engineering.Determine whether the Pmsp3 promoter can drive gene expression in AMB-1.Prove whether Mms13 and EGFP can be successfully expressed in AMB-1, and observe Mms13 anchored on the membrane of Magnetosome.As the engineered AMB-1 bacteria grow very slowly, so we use Spycatcher-GST instead to confirm the interaction between Spycatcher and Spytag .The recombined Mms13 and Spycatcher protein conjugates to Spytag and the complex can be simply co-purified by a magnet.It conjugates to Spycatcher and they can be simply co-purified by a magnet.As the TEV protease is still present in the final elution of the recombinant protein while using the TEV system.Due to quick proportional increase between molecular weight and incubation time in the beginning and tends to saturate with the time, we choose quadratic polynomial as the basic equation to fit our data.(R-square: 1, SSE: 5.099e-27)Meanwhile, we can get an equation that describes the relationship between protein molecular weight and optimal incubation time:Using the graph and equation above, we can easily predict the optimal incubation time in future for any recombinant protein.In the system using Magnetosome, we will evaluate the effects of other parameters on purification efficiency, including temperature, pH and incubation time.We then put data of different molecular weights into a graph that describes the correlation between binding rate of Spycatcher and Spytag, and time for three different molecular weights.The main formula of this method is shown as following:Using the four steps we can determine the factor that should be optimized firstly.In summary, we have generated equation and graphs that can be used to easily predict the optimal incubation time for any recombinant protein.The AMB-1 culture and prokaryotic expression processes of our experiments have lasted for nearly two months.So we design a device, the pulsed magnetic field generator (see device part) for AMB-1 incubation.Fig.5 This graph describes the relationship between protein molecular weight and optimal incubation time.We noticed that this graph fits well with the experimental data.Additionally, we used ultracentrifugation and electromagnet separator (see device part) for Magnetosome purification, then the membrane of Magnetosome was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Fig.1 (A) TEM image of AMB-1 incubated for 4 days (negative control).Then, adding arbitrary concentrations into the equation under each graph, we can get the corresponding time.(6\u00d7Z domian: 46KD, Spycatcher: 14KD, GST tag: 26KD)Fig.10 SDS-PAGE analysis of Spycatcher pull down 9\u00d7Z domain fused with Spytag at different incubation time.(3\u00d7Z domain: 24KD, Spycatcher: 14KD, GST tag: 26KD)Fig.9 SDS-PAGE analysis of Spycatcher pull down 6\u00d7Z domain fused with Spytag at different incubation time.This result proved that our device could work as expected.Fig.5 Magnetosomes were attracted by Electromagnet separatorWe use MagneGST-pull down to detect whether Spycatcher could bind with Spytag-TEV-Amilcp (STA) fusion protein from the Rosseta\u0092s lysate, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Based on data distribution, we predict that the trend or our data should fit in a polynomial equation.Fig.8 SDS-PAGE analysis of Spycatcher pull down 3\u00d7Z domain fused with Spytag at different incubation time.We used Mms13 protein as a fusion partner to express any protein of interest on the membrane of Magnetosome.For this purpose, we introduce the method called sensitivity analysis that deals with the change of model results when a parameter changes.This is intended to calculate additional data for the reactions of Spytag-3\u00d7Z domain/Spytag-6\u00d7Z domain/Spytag-9\u00d7Z domain with Spycatcher in triplicate at 37 \u00b0C for 1, 3, or 5 min, shown as the linear part of the reaction.To date, we have completed the transformation of ten vectors constructed by us into E. coli, and designed two devices, by which we can enhance AMB-1 bacterial growth and facilitate Magnetosome purification.(C) TEM image of Magnetosome after purification by ultracentrifugation and electromagnet separator.These results showed that a pulsed magnetic ?eld enhanced the growth of AMB-1 and Magnetosome formation (Fig.1).In order to simplify the description, we reciprocally use free Spycatcher\u0092s concentration and reaction time as two variables.By comparing the \u0093sensitivity coefficient\u0094 of each parameter, we can prioritize important factors of purification.A common method is the Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST).(9\u00d7Z domian: 67KD, Spycatcher: 14KD, GST tag: 26KD)Theoretically, many factors can influence the interaction between Spycatcher and Spytag, including temperature, pH, buffer types and protein molecular weights.The success of these planned research experiments and related processes demonstrated above will lead to the invention of a protein purification kit.In our future studies, we will integrate the essential genes for AMB-1\u0092s Magnetosome production into E. coli that can grow very quickly and thus can be a better host bacterial strain than AMB-1 to produce Magnetosomes.In order to achieve this, it is crucial important to culture AMB-1 and purify Magnetosome on a large scale.A covalent complex corresponding to the expected molecular weight (67KD) of Spycatcher-STA could be observed clearly.", "safety": "", "keywords":

protein\u0092s interior regions.The model aligned the \u0093annotated catalytic domain\u0094 against the primary sequence, and we did not pick split sites that fell in this window.Using these three criteria, we used our MATLAB tool to predict optimal regions in which to split our proteins.We hypothesized that such a model could lead to an important predictive tool for scientists, if it could ultimately find the few optimal places to split a protein that would create inert split halves but yield robust activity when dimerization occurs.Our first criterion was to avoid the secondary structures in the protein: the alpha helices and beta sheets.The model aligned the hydrophobicity profile against the primary sequence, and we did not pick split sites that fell in hydrophobic windows.Our third criterion was to avoid splitting within a known catalytic domain of each of the proteins.One of the main aspects of our project was to develop and refine a model that would help us predict the best places to split a protein, in order to most efficiently implement conditional dimerization.However, these are most easily identified through protein 3D structural analysis, rather than through the primary sequence.Over time, we think that more computational tools will be developed that can provide more insight into various levels of protein structure and how these contribute to function, and these could potentially be integrated into the model.We hypothesized that splitting through these sheets could also potentially disrupt folding activity and function.We used an online tool (JPRED) to predict where there would be alpha helices and beta sheets in the protein.The overall goal of the model was to narrow down the window of split site choices by focusing on feasible regions - regions that would be least likely to interfere with secondary, tertiary, and quarternary structure elements.This tool required input of the primary structure (linear amino acid sequence) of the protein as the input, and gave an output with the secondary structure prediction based on the linear sequence.Therefore, we focused on avoiding hydrophobic regions in the protein and targeting hydrophilic regions.We used the Janin hydrophobicity scale1, which assigns each amino acid in the primary sequence an index based on how hydrophobic it is (the higher the number is, the \u0093more hydrophobic\u0094 the amino acid is).We hypothesized that splitting within this functional domain could really interfere with the protein\u0092s overall activity.We wanted to avoid any such huge potential disruptions to protein activity so that our system would still have robust activity when the protein halves dimerize.We looked into the literature and found any relevant annotations of our proteins of interest, especially noting where catalytic domains may have been located.Protein primary sequence corresponds to the fundamental structure of the polypeptide chain; it is comprised of a string of amino acids that are covalently linked by peptide bonds.Also, we think that with more experimental validation, including our analyses, we can further refine some of the criteria.Ultimately we someday hope to see a refined tool that can input a protein\u0092s primary sequence and predict the most optimal split site(s).(This was our main contribution to the model itself.)Read our considerations below to learn more.We realized that these criteria do not account for all elements of a protein\u0092s secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure.Loops and turns are structures in the protein that might actually contribute significantly to overall protein function (many of these are binding sites).We took a running average of the hydrophobicity of 11 consecutive amino acids in the model to create a hydrophobicity profile of the entire protein.Theoretically, given that a protein that is n amino acids long, there are n-1 places to split the protein, since one can split the primary sequence between any amino acid (i.e.any peptide bond can be cleaved to yield two halves of the protein).Such a tool would be incredibly useful for researchers interested in splitting arbitrary proteins of interest, as well as for truly understanding all elements of protein structure.Our results for our protein splits can be found in the individual results sections of our application pages: Integrase/RDF results and SaCas9 results.We did not find catalytic domain/residue annotations for all of the proteins, and thus these images may not have these elements.Below is an image that incorporates all our criteria for one of the proteins that we tested.", "notebook": "Bacterial ProtocolsTo clone split protein constructs into our conditional dimerization backbones, we

Effect of gene location, mRNA secondary structures, and RNase sites on expression of two genes in an engineered operon[J].Thus, we are going to insert the stem-loops with required folding free energy between the coding regions of GSH?and GSH? to coordinate their relative expression.[1].Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for the production of 3-aminopropionic acid[J].Thus, for the sake of tuning the expressions of genes within polycistron, we aim to develop a tightly regulated, predictable components \u0096 stem-loop to realize cistrons concerto.As a matter of fact, regulation of gene expression includes a wide range of strategies that are used by synthetic scientists, for examples copy number, promoters and ribosome binding sites (RBSs)[6].Indeed, pathway optimization requires to adjust expression of multiple genes at appropriately balanced levels, for example the synthesic of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)[3] and Mevalonate[4].Combinatorial engineering of intergenic regions in operons tunes expression of multiple genes[J].Improved glutathione production by gene expression in Escherichia coli[J].Similarly, manipulation of multisubunit proteins (for example F1F0-ATPase) also requires coordinated expression of several genes to produce the subunits at the appropriate stoichiometries[5].Despite their prominent advantages, it is nearly impossible to predict the necessary strengths of the promoters and RBSs to balance and coordinate the expression of multiple genes[7].Thus, we decided to develop stem-loops with different folding free energy inserted in the intergenic region of two genes to coordinate expressions.The operon is transcribed by its sole promoter and the primary transcript is cleaved into several secondary transcripts by RNase E, a single-stranded, nonspecific endonuclease with preference for cleaving A/U-rich sequence .Thus we consider the possibility of stem-loops inserted in the intergenic region for tuning expression in E.coli which is more widely utilized as an engineered strain.Fortunately, Keasling has identified that stem-loops function well in the post-transcriptional process in E.coli[10], which confirmed our thought.Dudley Q M, Anderson K C, Jewett M C. Cell-Free Mixing of Escherichia coli Crude Extracts to Prototype and Rationally Engineer High-Titer Mevalonate Synthesis[J].Recently, in Clostridium cellulolyticum, within a polycistron encoding cellulosome, Xu reported that stem-loop structures associated with those intergenic post-transcriptional processed sites located at 3  end of highly transcribed genes exhibit folding free energy negatively correlated with transcript-abundance ratio of flanking genes[9].It involves the introduction of several genes encoding the enzymes of a metabolic pathway[1,2].Furthermore, the lower free energy of stem-loops are, the more stable the secondary transcripts of the upstream are, tuning the expression of multiple genes.For further developing stem-loops as useful regulatory parts, we racked our brains and divided our project into two parts.Metabolic engineering, 2015, 30: 121-129.[7].ACS Synthetic Biology, 2016.[5].ACS synthetic biology, 2016.[4].Cellulosome stoichiometry in Clostridium cellulolyticum is regulated by selective RNA processing and stabilization[J].Semi-rational approach for ultra-high poly (3-hydroxybutyrate) accumulation in Escherichia coli by combining one-step library construction and high-throughput screening[J].Nature communications, 2015, 6.[9].Nature Reviews Microbiology 11.1 (2013): 45-57.[10].Biotechnology and bioengineering, 2002, 80(7): 762-776.[10].Pfleger B F, Pitera D J, Smolke C D, et al.What s more, when traditional cloning is utilized, constructing libraries of hundreds of configurations of pathway genes with varying copy number, promoter, and RBS strength is a daunting and time consuming task even for small pathways[8].Ergo, we are enlightened to try a rational design of one regulatory element to mainly reduce the number of trials and transform it into a user-friendly kit.When stem-loops inserted in the 3\u0092 end of the upstream gene, it protects its mRNA against the degradation of exonuclease, increasing the ratio of abundance of the first gene product relative to that of the second gene product.Nature biotechnology, 2006, 24(8): 1027-103[8].Li T, Ye J, Shen R, et al.As is done in the prokaryotes, grouping a cluster of genes into a single polycistron is a convenient mean for regulating genes simultaneously.Liao X Y, Shen W, Chen J, et al.69, 407\u0096410 (2006).[6].We mainly focus on the prior design of the DNA sequences to work on the post-transcriptional level which can directly determine the relative levels of gene expression.Koffas, Metabolic pathway balancing and its role in the production of biofuels and chemicals.", "design": "With the growing research on structure prediction, this mechanism will get fully developed.With the dual-fluorescent reporter system and our designed stem-loops, we validated several different stem loops and developed them into a toolkit, convenient for others\u0092 use with result data measured by us.[1].\"Sealing nucleotides\": A pair of CG at the end of a stem-loop can help stabilizing the secondary structure by avoiding flanking extra base paring in different context circuit.We evaluated the folding free energy of different stem-loops with Mfold web server[6], a convenient on line web server for users.Upon the translational level, we explored the possibility and prospect of this post-transcriptional regulation method on practical application.We designed our regulation elements based on 3 parts: loop, stem and a tail ahead with a pair of CG as \u0093sealing nucleotides\u0094(Figure 2).Loop: Since the loop makes little contribution to the whole free energy, we used the same loop throughout our designs.There are two important components in our testing work, the testing platform--dual-fluorescent reporter system and the designed elements--stem-loops.We changed different stem-loops in turn into the dual-fluorescent reporter system to test their regulation effects.We constructed a dual-fluorescent reporter system as platform to test these parts(Figure 1).Based on Keasling[1] and Xu\u0092s[2] work, we devoted to exploring of a kind of novel regulation method.Choosing the ratio of 1:1, we can easily adjust the free energy by changing the length of the paring stem.By comparing the expression of the upstream GFP and downstream mCherry, we analyzed the different protection effect of stem-loops.We measured the quantitative expression on two levels: the transcriptional level and the translational level.Then we designed several stem-loops with different folding free energy and tested their regulation effects.Because too many C/G may cause the energy too low and hard to adjust, whereas too many A/U are easy to cause terminating effect owing to the structure similarity to rho-independent terminators[5].But the prediction may be not accurate enough constrained by the current research of the relationship between structure and free energy.Besides, we try to avoid poly-U structure on the flanking sequence to avoid terminating effect.That is U-U-A-C-A-U-G-A-U-U.Stem: The stem-loop\u0092s free energy is mainly decided by the pairing stem section.The promoter(BBa_I0500), RBS with GFP(BBa_I13500) and RBS with mCherry(BBa_J06602) are standard parts in the iGEM part registry.On the transcriptional level, we aimed to find if the difference is actually caused by the varied mRNA degradation.The RNase E site between them is from E.coli pap operon, a relative high efficient endonuclease cleavage site validated through experiments[4].Keasling, Effect of gene location, mRNA secondary structures, and RNase sites on expression of two genes in an engineered operon.Science, 1999, 284(5414): 611-615.[6].Journal of Biological Chemistry, 269(14), 10790-10796.[5].",

sequence, the software can find out corresponding stem loops and store them into the database.We have developed our own software which provides a database of stem loops.Moreover, when users need proteins expressed in specific quantity, such as inputting the ratio of two different proteins, the software can provide suitable stem loops according to the ratio.", "notebook": "We firstly tried to understand the process of degradation of mRNA, the transcription rate of mRNA and the cleavage efficiency of RNase E.For the wet lab, we continued to design new stem-loops and inserted them into circuits.We had our data of the expression of proteins in four circuits which showed the relationship with the free energy of stem-loops.Figure8 The protein fluorescence of upstream GFP to downstream mCherry of different circuits, background subtraction has been normalized with control group.Ratio = {[RFPterm/GFPterm]/[(RFPcontrol/GFPcontrol)mean]Meanwhile, we held the summer camp for students from different universities.These two circuits had new stem loops with different free energy and we tried to further verify the relationship between quantitative expression of proteins and the free energy of stem loops.Figure9 We had two designed stem loops which respectively had the same free energy with the origin one.For our wet lab, we had another new two circuits and we tested the expression of mRNA and proteins as usual.For collaboration, we collaborate with XMU 2016 to publish the survey of our project.We focus on measuring the strength of our promoter, pBAD promoter.What\u0092s more, we expanded our project to the three fluorescence reporting system and explore Gibson assembly to do this.For collaboration, we continued contacting with HFUT-China, they helped measure our part sequence by their software and give us some suggestion about the genes and relevancy.We started to standardized our parts and did collaboration with JNFLS 2016, they helped us to use flow cytometry to measure the fluorescence intensity of GFP and mCherry of circuit 3 according to our protocol.We also carried out our other parts of human practice, like holding summer camp for students from other universities.We successfully used overlap to construct our circuit which included GFP and mCherry as two fluorescent reporter proteins.We also tried to insert stem loops in our circuit and we successfully annealed and extended the primer.We learned the protocol of how to extract mRNA and started to do experiment from circuit 1 to circuit 4.We also started to measure the growth curve of E.coli by using UV spectrophotometer, which under the wave length of 600 to decide the time point of detecting the expression of protein.We got the results of the growth curve of E.coli and ensured that they would arrive logarithmic phase after 6-7 hours and arrive stationary phase after 21-22 hours.We started to test the expression of GFP and mCherry in circuit 1 to 4 by using microplate reader.Our wet lab group was divided into three groups: extracting mRNA, detecting the expression of protein and detecting the mRNA.At first, we designed four circuits that both had the same promoter, RBS, terminator and two fluorescent proteins GFP and mCherry.For human practice, we went to Qingdao Science and Technology Museum to hold a lecture for about 100 people to popularize synthetic biology and the importance of quantification in our daily life.Figure7 We held a lecture for the delegation from TibetFor the dry lab, we wanted to get the relationship that the concentration of mRNA changed with the time.Both in the third and fourth circuits, there was stem-loops but circuit 4 had an RNase site.We divided our wet group into two parts to use enzyme cleavage and overlap respectively to construct our circuits.We met problem that the BFP couldn\u0092t transform or emit fluorescence.We introduced iGEM and synthetic biology to them by organizing lecture, operating experiment, designing their own posters.We went to Guangzhou to attend CCiC and communicated with about 30 iGEM teams there.We had two new circuits and three parts of our wet lab group started to test them.We came up with the idea that controlling the quantitative expression of proteins by inserting different stem-loops into circuits.Our wet lab, dry lab and also design group started to work!We established our team consisting 12 students from different grades and different majors and then registered our team, OUC-China.For our wet lab, we came up with problems when we organized the logical thoughts of our project therefore we went to Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences to consult professors.We confirmed our pre-experiment design.We got the positive correlation between the quantity of mRNA and the free energy of stem loops.Figure6 The correlation between the quantity of mRNA and the free energy of stem loopsAt the same time, we designed more stem loops with various free energy and inserted them into new circuits.Then we did experiment to verify that the stem loop wouldn\u0092t cause terminate, resulting in the downstream protein could express approximately constantly in circuit with and without stem loops.Moreover, we communicated about the team management and personnel recruitments and selection.We started to construct our circuits by ourselves.We thought that the part we used couldn\u0092t work well so we decided to use GFP rather than BFP.to design our own circuits.Figure2 The figure shows the fluorescent of downstream mCherry in the circuit with or without stem-loop, and there\u0092s no significant difference between them(P=0.01).Firstly, we needed to make sure that our parts like GFP and mCherry could work well.", "protocol": "1)Luria-Bertani liquid and Luria-Bertani solid medium", "result": "With the demands of bigger library and more detailed data, we are working on more stem-loops to expand our toolkit library.Figure.6Structure of three stem-loops designed by ourselvesWe measured them both on transcriptional and translational level.As shows, these parts tune the ratio of the upstream and downstream genes as well.Figure.4Structure of three stem-loops designed by ourselvesFigure.5 Both relative expression on RNA and protein level of designed stem-loops of -30.1, -34.4,38.8,44.9kcal/mol (measured by Mfold) compare to the control group without stem-loop.Hence we tested another two native stem-loops in the following.Figure.3 Stem-loops with lower folding free energy lead to stronger protection of upstream gene, which results in higher ratio of GFP to mCherry both in transcriptional and translational level.Ergo, we use two native stem-loops from R. capsulatus and E.coli[2] and a previously experimented stem-loops with different free energy to preliminary verify that stem-loops in the intergenic region can regulate the relative expression of two reporter genes within polycistrons.Below is the relative expression on two levels of different stem-loops in our toolkit.Figure.7 RNA varying with folding free energy of stem-loopsFigure.8 Protein expression varying with folding free energy of stem-loopThere may be certain relationship between the relative expression and free energy, so we did more to explore the relationship, see details at model.We measured them on both transcriptional and translational level.Figure.1 Both relative expression on RNA and protein level with stem-loop of -25.6 kcal/mol (measured by Mfold) are significantly higher than those of control group without stem-loop, which means stem-loops can coordinate the expression within cistrons.Employing the same rules, we designed several stem-loops (Figure.4) with various free folding energy and tested them (Figure.5).of mean of experiments in triplicate.After the function and sequences of stem-loops confirmed, we standardized and submitted them to iGEM part registry with detailed description.Results suggested that stem-loops at 3\u0092 end functioned well in regulation.of mean of experiments in triplicateIn addition to the confirmation of previous stem-loops, we also devoted to exploring new stem-loops designed by ourselves.And with the demands of bigger library and more detailed data, we are working on more stem-loops to expand our toolkit

regulations about shipping DNA from China to the USA, which is forbidden without tedious red tape.Before working in the lab, we are supposed to be trained by the skillful hands, not only for the general lab safety rules, but also for the standard experimental operation avoiding unnecessary damage.And a molecular operation area, an ethidium bromide area and a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis

6:30-8:00pm and 9:30-11:00pm.2.Lab cleaning must be done twice a week with disinfectant moping the floor for at least 3times.3.Well prepared experiment plans should be written before you start.4.Lab coats and gloves must be worn when conducting experiments.5.Short skirts, shorts, and open shoes must not be worn.6.If you see a colleague doing something dangerous, point it out to him or her.7.Lab coats must not be worn outside laboratories and in public areas.8.Know where safety equipment (eyewash, shower and extinguisher) is located.For the sake of environments, all the chassis organisms will be sterilized before being abandoned to prevent the genes from leaking.We works at a neat lab named \u0093Lab for Microinnovation and Enterprise\u0094, which is a BSL-2 laboratory.As a matter of fact, when using stem-loops to tune the expression of genes, it is harmless for the growth of bacteria and relatively safe for industrialized applications.What\u0092s more, nonpathogenic bacteria,

up stream of P(3HB).)We sent the plamids with correct size to sequencing, the results showed that phaC1-A-B1 was successfully linked to the down stream of HSP promoter and pBAD promoter.We transformed the correct plasmids to TransB(DE3) for expression, and set different conditions for inducement as shown in table 1.After inducement, we extracted P(3HB).)We used Spe I and Pst I to do dual digestion in pSB1C3 which contained HSP gene and recycled gene fragments in 2117bp, used Spe I and Pst I to do dual digestion in pSB1C3 which contained pBAD gene and recycled gene fragments in 3280bp, used Xbal

Trans 5? for plasmid extraction.", "design": "In order to solve this problem, we use E.coli Rossatta(DE3) as our expression strain [2][3].Taxol plays an important role in mammalian tubulin aggregation, the mainly interaction sites are K19, V23, D26, H227, F270 on ?-tubulin[4].So we extract and purify the porcine origin tubulin, design a series of aggregation experiment in vitro, expecting to provide a positive control for the fusion proteins expressed from prokaryotic cells.WANG Xin-yi, NI Rong(2012).All these vectors are transformed into E.coli TransB(DE3) cells for the expression of our objective proteins(Fig.0.1).After expression and purification of ?-tubulin(linked with N/C terminal of signaling proteins) and ?-tubulin, we mix them in vitro and add taxol sample.When the two parts are expressed separately and mixed together in vivo or in vitro, they cannot aggregate into a complete protein, so no fluorescence can be detected[8][9][10][11].As an inexpensive raw material which can be easily purchased, they are always used for microtubule extraction[16] Since microtubule is conservative in both animal and plant, the microtubules purified from animal tissues can also be used in plant science research.To test the aggregation of microtubule effectively, we design the fusion proteins of tubulin subunit and fragments of signal proteins.Based on current status, we hope to express human tubulin monomers in E.coli prokaryotic expression system, and use FLC(Firefly Luciferase Complementation) or BiFC(Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation) to detect the aggregation degree of tubulin monomers in vitro.Fig.3 The construction of tubulin monomer and YFP fragment fusion sequencesBased on the design mentioned above, the final product can be carried out as a standardized kit(Fig.4).We design the N-terminal and C-terminal primers based on YFP\u0092s sequence, using pSPYNE and pSPYCE as templates, running PCR to get YNE and YCE gene sequences.Then we use the same design as luciferase, both of which serve as the signal proteins(Fig.3).Fig.2.3 The aggregation of microtube under taxol treatmentBesides the methods mentioned above, we also use yellow fluorescence protein(YFP) to construct a similar system based on BiFC theory.We split YFP into N-terminal(YNE, amino acids 1~155) and C-terminal(YCE, amino acids 156~240).In order to reduce the nonsense collision between protein molecules and reduce the background fluorescence, we use semi-solid mixed crowding as the buffer[5].Fig.2.1 The fused construction of tubulin monomer and luciferase fragmentAt the same time, we use Gateway large-scale cloning technology to construct nluc-?-tubulin and ?-tubulin-cluc gene sequences, ligating them to pET30a(+) expression plasmid(as shown in Fig.2.1).There would be a relationship between the intension of fluorescence and the length of microtubule(Fig.2.3).Our kit contains 5 parts:The purified ?-tubulin-nluc fusion protein, ?-tubulin-cluc fusion protein, ?-tubulin-YNE fusion protein, ?-tubulin-YCE fusion protein and ?-tubulin dissolved in mixed crowding respectively.A standard curve for taxol concentration \u0096 intensity of excitation fluorescence.Quantitative detection of Taxol\u0092s concentration in taxol fermentation broth.Tubulins of animal origin has the ability of self-assembly under proper condition in vitro.Moreover, a GGGGSGGGGSGGGS protein linker is also established to the fragment between two target genes(Fig.2.1).It can be determined whether n-luciferase and c-luciferase maintain the normal function after fusing with tubulin monomer by observing the fluorescence exists or not.The proteins who are verified successfully are applied to the further research.The intensity of background light when monomers do physical collision in solution can be calculated, and we can verify whether active n-luciferase and c-luciferase can be expressed in prokaryotic expression system.Fusion PCR technology is applied in the further construction of our bio-bricks.Nluc-?-tubulin and ?-tubulin-cluc fusion proteins are expressed and purified with the same method mentioned above.Based on this principle, we plan to use our designed novel system to detect the existence of taxol, and hope to quantify its concentration through fluorescence intensity.In order to achieve our goal, We ligate N-luciferase and C-luciferase(or YNE and YCE) to ?-tubulin respectively for n-luc-?-tublin(YNE-?-tublin) and c-luc-?-tublin(YCE-?-tublin) vectors.The target genes were on the up stream of his-tag and down stream of T7 promoter, and transform the constructed vectors into E.coli TransB(DE3) to express our protein[12][13][14].Through modeling, we know that the length of microtubule and the concentration of taxol is positively correlated[7], so we can fit a standard curve according to the concentration of taxol and the intension of fluorescence detected in the experiment.They help us to verify whether our constructed vectors can express active tubulin monomers in prokaryotic system.According to previous research, taxol can not only longitudinally stabilize the dimer in protofilament but also laterally stabilize neighboring protofilaments[1][4].Thus, we design and synthesize primers based on the sequence of luciferase, using FLC plasmids pCambia1300-N-Luciferase and pCambia1300-C-Luciferase as PCR templates to get the gene sequence of n-luciferase and c-luciferase respectively.We design primers to add EcoR I as well as Xho I restriction enzyme sites at two sides of n-luciferase and c-luciferase.Since a certain length of microtubule is needed as a premise for taxol\u0092s function, GTP is added into the system to make the heterodimers aggregate into a loci.Visualization of protein interactions in living plant cells using bimolecular ?uorescence complementation(2004).Once the two parts are fusing expressed with a pair of proteins who can interact with each other, YFP can regain its function.Purified n-luciferase and c-luciferase are mixed together, after that, we add luciferin B into the system and test the light absorption at 560nm via spectrophotometer.Thus we design and synthesize primers based on the sequence of human ?-tubulin, adding Hind III and Xho I restrictive sites to the 5  and 3  flanked sites respectively.When GTP and Mg2+ are added into near-neutral pH buffer PIPES, tubulin heterodimers can aggregate into microtubule automatically under room-temperature(or 37?).Detection of protein\u0096protein interactions in plants using bimolecular fluorescence complementation(2004).Since taxol interacts with ?-tubulin[4], we design to fuse luciferase fragments to ?-tubulin in order to avoid the potential steric effects.The luciferase was split into N-terminal(amino acids 1~416) and C-terminal(amino acids 417~570) fragments.Bimolecular fluorescence complementation: visualization of molecular interactions in living cells(2008).Since the more tubulin heterodimers taking part in the aggregation activity, the more complete luciferase can exist.These rare codons may lead to the abnormal expression of tubulin in prokaryote.We used spectrophotometer to detect the intension of emission fluorescence of microtubule under different taxol treatment condition with excitation wavelength of 527 nm.Since ?-tubulin and ?-tubulin can combine as heterodimer spontaneously in vitro, we mix ?-tubulin-cluc or cluc-?-tubulin with nluc-?-tubulin as system1, mix ?-tubulin-nluc or nluc-?-tubulin with ?-tubulin-cluc as system2, and then add luciferin B to both systems.First, we mix ?-tubulin-nluc, ?-tubulin-cluc with ?-tubulin to get nluc-tubulin dimer and cluc-tubulin dimer respectively(Fig.2.2).We extract mRNA from Mcf7(human breast cancer cell line), obtain cDNAs via reverse transcription and use these as PCR templates to get a-tubulin, ?-tubulin respectively.We ligate ?-tubulin, ?-tubulin to pET30a(+) vector.Fluorescence intensity will tell the concentration of taxol or its analogues(Fig.0.2).The establishment of molecular model targeting to microtubule proteins for screening the compounds from

learn about the public attitude and knowledge to yew protection, we carried on a public research in Heilongtan Park, Yunnan University and Kunming Botanical Garden, Kunming.Here is ourWe learned that nearly half of people are lacking basic knowledge about the yew trees.At the same time, the understand of yew trees varies a lot in different people.In Yunnan province, many folk prescriptions mentioned yew barks as a traditional Chinese medicine, which may be one of the reasons why people know a lot about medical therapy.And after we ask further we noticed that these markets usually distribute in the aggregation place of wild yew trees such as Lijiang.Besides, over 90% people thought that there are not many yew trees in the wild and they needed enhanced protection.The yew trees and its wood are both valuable so the artificial forest is a great protection of wild trees.Fig.5 Knowledge of application of yews change with age.Among these people, the teenagers have a more comprehensive knowledge about the application of yew trees, while the old know more about the medical value of yew.Through the random investigation we learned that almost half of residents know some markets selling yew products while tourists know little about this.There are also some people collecting yew woodBesides, we learned that the knowledge of yew mainly spread through leisure chatting or learn from families and friends.Fig.4 How do people from different places know about the application of yew treesPeople living in Kunming and surrounding counties have a better knowledge than tourists from other provinces.And a sizable part of the old took or are taking yew medicines like yew wine and so on.Dr. Zhang\u0092s view about protecting yew is that artificial forest is so popular that we don\u0092t need to constrain the yew productions in the market.Besides, its wood is also precious (Though we can t agree with some of what heAs to planting yew trees, the farmers should get united with enterprises, who can give guide to farmers and ensure the quality of yews.And the taxol content in yew should reach a criterion, which need chemical methods nowadays to analysis, to ensure the subsequent product rate and quality.So many yew production sellers play an important role in popularization of yew science and the information theyHande Biotechnology Corporation is a mature company with long history.In the YAF, Dr. Jinfeng Zhang and his fellow said that it s important to nurture artificial yew forests, especially from the angle of economy and forestry.But when it comes to the present situation of yew protection, the understanding Fig.7 How does people thinks about protection of yew.The most locals thought that the protecting condition of the yew is unfavorable while people from other provinces argues the opposites.And taxol, a broad-spectrum medicine targeting on the microtubule, is just a choice for cancer doctors.Taxus is just a kind of the miscellaneous plants in the world and he thought that the natural effect is more important than human activities for he thought about this problem in a further larger time scale.Inspired by the properties of microtubule-stabilizing agent taxol, we developed a method to screen medicines based on the microtubule stabilization.In this lively morning, we walked through the campus.We noticed that though these people are all studying about the same species, they think about it from totally different dimensions.During the conference, we introduced our project to the other 26 teams.In the conference, each team conducted in-depth communication and exchanged ideas on their own projects.In the other hand, taxol treatment is a relative affordable scheme in most cases.In the meantime, we also held open attitude towards the sincere suggestions and comments from other teams.In the conference, not only did we strengthen the relationship with FAFU-CHINA, but we made many new friends as well.The rules of the orienteering are designed to bring our ideas to more people.I always want to get a chance to train my laboratory experiment skills and do the experiment in the lab but I didn t find the opportunity to do that, and this is one of the reasons of my participation.The public attribute to yew trees and its protection changes a lot among different people.To start with, as a freshman who has little impression to the campus, the orienteering makes me feel more familiar to the college.It has become one of the most serious problems facing by China, even globe, to treat cancer effectively.Besides, we carried on population survey in Heilongtan Park, Yunnan University and KunmingFrom our survey, we learned that there are more and more yew tree plant bases coming into being in Yunnan and they are mainly allocated at sipsongpanna, Wenshan, Diqing, and so on.Once upon a time, they were drew into a dilemma for they were accused of using wild yew trees.As the first company in China to produce taxol, it drew our attention immediately.And the communication and mutual learning among the teams provided us with the opportunity to broad our horizon and help us acquaint more peopleIn order to facilitate the communication between the students and to help students to get a deeper understanding of iGEM.So we spend several days this summer in Yunnan investigating the yew trees there.So, in these years, the government has taken measures to protect them.That\u0092s truly inspiring.Went to Pecking Union Medical College Hospital for an interviewDifferent anticancer medicines are clinically used in different cases, depending on the condition and illness history of the patient.As its name, the competition is for small iGEM projects designed by ten groups.In recent years, cancer has become one of the most serious killers threatening human health.However, the detecting and screening of medicines now is conducted based more on chemical methods, which is sometimes complex and time-consuming.Our Human Practice is based on the project and included interviews, investigations and games weWe organized the Mini-iGEM competition, which took a month, before our project began.Yesterday, we were strangers passing by each other but today we become a group, running and laughing in the school.Dr. Liu \u0091s talk is mainly about the systematic evolution of Taxus species.After further study, we learned that there have been cases in Kunming Botany Garden that people skinned the yew for money.Our team, BNU-China, had the chance to attend to the conference.I have learned the detailed introduction to the laboratory and the project from seniors and get the third place prize.After careful preparation, we showed our project roundly to the whole attendees from the aspects of background, project, design, modeling and human practice.The protection of wild yew trees goes well in Yunnan province.Then we are wondering whether those measures truly work and how is everything going with yew trees now in Yunnan.They now mainly use yew trees tissue as a resource of products.But it is the wide-ranging that limits its application.Each team should find their destination by the description written on the task card to get a chemical compound.We designed and organized an orienteering activity \"running of biology\" in the campus.Happy :) Fig.11 Participants visited the iGEM labs after the game.However, since the great performance in curing cancer was discovered, yew trees in Yunnan have experienced a period of massacre, which caused a sharp decrease in yew population.Among people from other provinces, some learned yew from internet or books, and some learned from sellers.The team that uses the less time to collect all the chemical compound will win the game.The orienteering is entrusted but full of joy and meanings.They focused more on the profit of taxol products and they are also playing an important role in yew resources protection.I hope to becomeThe combination of the cross-country and the iGEM experiment is full of fun.And the support to scientific research and forestry study from government are strengthened these years.The destinations were set at several typical buildings in the campus and was named by some representative chemical compound we have used or produced in the experiment, such as alpha protein, beta protein, N terminal of luciferase, c terminal of luciferase and some other organic molecular.As Dr. Zhang said, government should focus on protection, and leaves the yew market to itself.I feel I am getting close to the mysterious scientific research.And then the team will obtain the task card leading to the next destination.The distribution of wild yew trees is separated and in small population, for both natural and human reasons.He said that, the yew trees do have other values in addition to anticancer.They now have their own planting bases and will develop chemical synthesize method to make the production more profitable.The interviews to Dr. Jinfeng Zhang from YAF and Dr. Jie Liu from KIB is mainly from scientific view to argue about exploitation and protection politics of yew.", "modeling": "If all the GTP-dimers at the endpoint become the GDP-dimers or there is not enough (T_1) and (T_2) in the solution, the growing process is stop.The flow chart of this process can be illustrated as follow:According to the flow chart, we can get the ODE equations as follow.$dot{G_{12}}=(r_1 + r_2)G_{11}-k_{1}G_{11}+r_1 G_{21}- h G_{12}$We can get numerical solutions easily by Matlab as soon as initial (T_1)and (T_2) are given.(\rho) is the density of the tubulin solution in (D) .(initial (T_1)=50000, initial (T_2)=3000, initial (G_{11})=3000, Initial (G_{21})=1000)What we can get from our ODE model is (G_1) and (G_2), which indicate the quantity of filaments with GTP-cap and Taxol-cap, which is equal to the number of GTP-dimers at endpoint and the number of Taxol-dimers at endpoint.Also (G_{11})and (G_{21}) can disaggregate into the solution and become dissociative dimers ((T_1) and (T_2) again.In a similar way (overrightarrow{f_2}) is the velocity of the disaggregation mass which flow out the (D) and (overrightarrow{f_2}) can be considered as the product of outflow velocity (overrightarrow{v_2}) and disaggregation ratio (r) there is no need to consider the (overrightarrow{v_2}) and (r) .Considering in the time range , according to the mass conservation: (overrightarrow{f_1}) is the velocity of assembling of the solution which flow into the (D) .So the outflow mass during (dt) through any (dS) of the (partial D) can be given:$$\rho cdot overrightarrow{f_2} cdot overrightarrow{n} cdot dS cdot dt $$According to the mass conservation we can get the equation:$$iiint_D(\rho |_{t=t_2}- \rho |_{t=t_1})dxdydz=- int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt iint_{partial D} \rho overrightarrow{f_1} overrightarrow{n}dS+ int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt iint_{partial D} \rho overrightarrow{f_2} overrightarrow{n}dS$$Assuming that (\rho) , (overrightarrow{f_1}) , (overrightarrow{f_2}) are all continuously differentiable, according to Gauss Formula we can get that:$$int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt [iiint_D frac{partial \rho}{partial t} + \nabla cdot (\rho overrightarrow{f_1})- \nabla cdot (\rho overrightarrow{f_2})]dxdydz=0 $$Because of the continuity of integrand in and the randomicity of and , we can get that:$$frac{partial \rho}{partial t} + \nabla cdot (\rho overrightarrow{f_1})- \nabla cdot (\rho overrightarrow{f_2})=0, quad Omega \times (0, infty) $$ (\rho_0) , (\rho_t) can be measured directly in the experiment.We build the partial differential equations and definition conditions based on the conservation laws.The tubulin solution area (Omega) is thought to be a kind of fluid motion.The dependent variable is the change of the micrutubule\u0092 length, our modeling is shown below:In the equation (1), (y) is the dependent variable, the change of the microtubule s length.At first, initial (T_1) and (T_2) are added in the solution.(overrightarrow{f_1}) can be regarded as the product of the velocity (overrightarrow{v}) and the assembling ratio (k) .The proportion of the change of independent variable in all change of the dependent variable becomes bigger, in other words, F has a higher value, independent variable influence dependent variable more.$$ H_0:?_1=?_2=?=?_k quad vs quad H_1=quad not quad H_0 \tag{5}$$ (H_0) stands for that different values of the independent variable?the added taxol\u0091s concentration) make no difference to the mean value of the dependent variable(the light absorption value OD350), in other words, the independent is not important to the dependent variable.For the (overrightarrow{f_1}), (overrightarrow{f_2}) , we can estimate the value range based on our experiments and determine the the most appropriate value according to the simulated annealing algorithm.For example, the measured length of the microtubule will be different when we add taxol into the test tube.On the basis of the theory, our F test statistics is: $$ F = frac{SSA/(n-k)}{SSE/(k-1)} sim F(n-k, k-1) \tag{4}$$The numerator of the equation is a part of the dependent variable which can be explained by the change of the independent variable, while the denominator of the equation can be explained by other random elements except the change of the independent variable.(G_{11}) and (G_{21}) can become (G_{12}) and (G_{22}) if new dimers are aggregated at the endpoint.Obviously, initial (T_1) is related to the initial Taxol concentration.Then the (\rho(x,y,z,t)) can be calculate according to the equation and definition conditions.stands for the residual between dependent variable\u0092s value and it\u0092s mean value, also obey the normal distribution (N(0, sigma_i ^2))Then we construct the F test statistics.(y_{ij}) is the (j) observed value of the independent variable under the (i) level.Therefore, we can t think the independent variable make distinct influence on the dependent variable.For studying the dynamic progress of tubulin assembling under the influence of Taxol, we build the differential equations to describe such progress numerically.Especially, the difference between Taxol-dimer and GTP-dimer is that new fixed aggregation Taxol-dimer will not disaggregate and become dissociative again.According to literature [2], every Taxol-dimer and GTP-dimer may hydrolyze into GDP-dimer, which can no longer combine new dimers and growth.As we discussed in the modeling theory, we only consider three main phenomena: disaggregation, aggregation and hydrolysis.Now we consider how these filaments growth specifically.First, we define the quadratic sum of the residual: $$ SSE = sum_{i=1}^k sum_{j=1}^{n_i} (y_{ij}-overline y_1)^2 \tag{2}$$ $$ SSA = sum_{i=1}^k n_i (overline y_{1}-overline y)^2 \tag{3}$$SSA reflects the variance between different levels and the difference is made by the different elements; SSE reflects the variance in a certain level and this random difference is due to the selected sample\u0092s random.Accordingly, initial (T_2) is related to the initial GTP-dimer quantity.Then we verified the influence of taxol to the fluorescent protein.Because the interpreted variable is discrete, we use the Box Plot to describe the intensity of emission of microtubulin under the different concentration of the Taxol.Then we use R software to conduct F-test, the outcome is shown below:From the outcome, (F\u0092s) value is 1.337, nearly 1.By constructing the F-test statistics, we can use the one-way analysis of variance to study whether classification of the independent variable\u0092s different levels can make significant influence on the variation of the continuous variable.Finally, the variation tendency can be described through the integration iiint_D \rho(x,y,z,t)dxdydzWe applied to programing visualization in this complex process based on certain laws of Microtubule dynamic instability.Fig.9 Numerical results of microtubule growth simulationFig.10 Visual Simulation of microtubule with 13 protofilamentsCaplow M, Shanks J. Microtubule dynamic instability does not result from stabilization of microtubules by tubulin-GDP-Pi subunits.[J].Therefore, we can think the data meets the requirement about the homogeneity of variance and we can use the one-way analysis of variance to deal with the data.The independent variable is a classified variable which values 0 and 1 to describe whether the tax is added into the test tube.Apart from that, the single microtubule will always in the stage of aggregation and disaggregation.Tubulin is made up of two tubulin monomers which are nearly the same as each other.is the mean of dependent variable under the (i) level.Since it should be proportionate to quantities of microtubules only by a coefficient (lambda ), we can use this to simulate the results whose condition is used in the wet parts.In the next part of the modeling, we will use the one-way analysis of variance to analyze the data, and then deal with the data.To determine whether the data suitable for single factor analysis of varianceWe use the SPSS to do the homogeneity test of variance with the data we got, the outcome is shown in the figure below: Fig.4 The figure of the data\u0092s homogeneity test of varianceFrom the figure, we can see the data\u0092s variance is 0.519, bigger than 0.05.If the levels have a significant influence, we can further give the 95% confidence interval of the dependent variable means under the different levels of the independent variable, and then we can analyze the degree of the different levels.In order to verify and test the degree of the taxol\u0092s influence on microtubule\u0092s length.According to the distribution of characteristic bands, we divide CPS value into four bands and use the Box Plot to describe them respectively.This analysis can help us gain the overall understanding of the data, find the abnormal data, and then guide our next work.We summarized tubulin-inflorescence fusion protein\u0092s intensity of emission at around 520-530 nm wavelength under different taxol\u0092s concentration treatments.From the figure, we can see four boxplots.First we have to consider what happened in the tubulin solution.Then, we use the one-way analysis of variance to deal with the data given by the experiment.Before we use the one-way analysis of variance to deal with the data, we need to conduct some simple descriptive statistical analysis.Now there is a widely accepted feature about the microtubule that microtubule has highly complicated dynamic instability.We establish some mathematical model including partial differential equations to describe these rules especially the mechanism of numerical relationships in the tubulin.In this process, the length and amount of the tubulin are in the dynamic equilibrium or changing.All these promoters are initial conditions in the experiment.Line graphs are shown here.According to the picture above we can tell that adding taxol would influence the emission intensity of the fluorescent protein, which induces the shape and position changes of the intensity curve.It is thought that the switching from growth to shrinkage occurs due to the loss of the GTP-cap.Caplow M[1] research shows that when the cap structure of microtubule plus end subunit containing GDP- beta tubulin instead of GTP- beta tubulin, microtubule becomes unstable and will quickly disaggregate.As is shown in the figure, there are two kinds of Dimer, called GDP and GTP, with blue and red two connected to the circular.In the solution there are many assembling of tubulins, the hydrolysis, aggregations and disaggregation of the protein filaments.That of experimental groups with different taxol\u0092s concentration (final concentration: 0 ?m, 0.5 ?m, 5 ?m, 25 ?m, 50 ?m, 100 ?m, 250 ?m and 500 ?m) are basically similar except of the whole translation of wave band.We consider the tubulin length is the function of time, assembling rate, disaggregation and hydrolysis rate.The quantity in the solution area is certainly ruled by conservation laws no matter what shape of the area is.Based on these studies, we can make the better plan, central or prediction in the experiments.We only consider tree main phenomenon in the solution: disaggregation, aggregation and hydrolysis.Each of them stands for a certain concentration of the TAX?the straight line in the box is the median of the data under a certain concentration, standing for the average of the light absorption value OD350 under this concentration.We know that the differential equations can describe the numerical relationships and patterns between related promoters.We can find that data have a big inner undulation under the concentration of TAX greater than 12.5, but when the concentration is between 5 and 12.5, the undulation of the data is tiny.Only Taxol-dimer and GTP-dimer, no matter they are dissociative or already fixed on the filament, can aggregate new Taxol-dimer and GTP-dimer.At the same time, the endpoint GTP may also be made off, thereby protofilaments shorter.According to the literature, there are some relationships between these promoters.In addition to this, the average of the light absorption value OD350 is high under the TAX\u0092s concentration from 0 to 1 and the TAX\u0092s concentration above 12.5.Besides, there are chances that the GTP can hydrolysis to GDP, which can no longer combine the new GTP.But the precondition is that the data should satisfy the homogeneity of variance, in other words, the variance of the data should be the independent identically distributed.", "notebook": "We recycled the plasmid backbone (pET30a(+)) following the agarose gel DNA extraction kit, and gene segments following the DNA fragment purification kit, ligated,

instability.The mechanism of the taxol in the microtubules dynamic assembly process had important significance.In order to well study the taxol s influence in the dynamic assembly process, we divided into four steps on the dynamic process modeling.We assembled standard carrier: we ligated the target gene which had been assembled in pET30a(+) with pSB1C3 by PCR, enzyme digestion, and transformation.The result of ?-YNE, ?-YCE, YCE-?, ?-YCE, YCE-?, cluc-? is correct.We studied the taxol\u0092s influence in the dynamic assembly process.We promoted parts: we extracted plasmid in kit 2

inserted it into a strain of E. coli.We designed two parts (BBa_K1895000 and BBa_K1895006) which respond to the heat-stress in two different ways:BBa_K1895000 contains the E. coli htpG promoter.This composite part also contains a modified BioBrick compatible ?32 coding region (the gene rpoH, BBa_K1895001) which will create a positive feedback loop to the PhtpG promoter, therefore increasing the expression of the downstream reporter gene sfGFP and the fluorescence of the cell.BBa_K1895006 contains the dnaK promoter which, like PhtpG, is transcribed via binding of RNA polymerase by ?32.We took the smtA gene, (BBa_K519010), and put it under the control of a PBAD promoter, induced by the presence of L-arabinose, making our BioBrick BBa_K1895999.This should allow us to control the uptake of zinc ions by adding or removing L-arabinose, resulting in control over the resistance of the LB media.We aimed to look at different ways of improving the voltage output of a microbial fuel cell.PdnaK is placed upstream of the BBa_0034 RBS and BBa_I746916 sfGFP.We aimed to create a biological \u0093variable resistor\u0094 by modifying the E. coli\u0092s natural systems to allow for controlled ion uptake.Bielefeld also had issues with cell growth due to the metabolic stress of using a T7 promoter.One of the issues we noticed with their design was that their porin overexpression protein was taken from Pseudomonas fluorescens and so the pores size was too large for the E. coli to handle.At first we looked at yeast microbial fuel cells with the help of Dr Ed Milner, Dr Paniz Izadi and Professor Ian Head, but after talking with PEALS we decided to move away from using yeast and looked at working with E. coli instead.", "design": "When we discussed this challenge with staff from the

to consider the potential implications.", "human_practice": "In order to explore various human practices issues to do with our project, we carried out a number of activities to look at our project from several angles.Conversations with academics in the field of synthetic biology and biotechnology, including Dr Lucy Eland and Professor Angharad Gatehouse.An interview with Dr Simon Woods, Co-director of the Policy, Ethics and Life Science (PEALS) Research Centre at Newcastle University.Engagement with a group of pre-university students (17/18 years old) to discuss their perception of the ethical issues and the design of the breadboard.Started social media interaction on Facebook and Twitter.These led to a number of changes in our project approach, including:The development of a  thought experiment  game, to collect feedback about public opinion on the potential uses of bio-electronics.A change in our host chassis, from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to Escherichia coli for our microbial fuel cell.Redesigning features of the breadboard, including the colour and connection method.During our conversation with Dr Eland, she raised concerns about the environmental sustainability of the materials used in the implementation of our designs.In an opinion piece for Forbes, Miller and Kershaw (2012) argue that the EU needs to embrace synthetic biology, with a tailored set of regulations.In order to get feedback on the design of our breadboard product, we hosted two sessions to discuss our project idea with 17/18 year old students.Due to anticipated better control of designing kill switch mechanisms, E. coli was deemed to be the most suitable organism.Related to Dr Woods  first point about temporal shifts in public opinions, he also identified that it would be important for a foundational advance with intended public use to have continual evaluation of the public opinion of issues related to the means (e.g.While we feel this may be useful for future use in S. cerevisiae projects, it was recognised that the greater knowledge available about the regulation of E. coli responses to environmental conditions would facilitate the design of features such as kill switches (related to the specific conditions in designed components).Furthermore, it could also be built in as an anti-tampering strategy.We integrated both of Dr Woods  points into our practices by changing the chassis organism of the microbial fuel cell from S. cerevisiae to E. coli.Until a generalised method is developed for biocontainment of specific organisms; using the species with the most researched biocontainment methods is the most logical decision for our breadboard.With the development of bio-electronics, the potential applications that could be integrated with them is also expanding.As one intended end-user of the breadboard, we were keen to get feedback that we could use to improve the likelihood of a student engaging with the breadboard, as well as experience they had with using the breadboard itself.Regarding the breadboard design, the students gave two specific pieces of advice that influenced the final breadboard design.We decided to develop our own thought experiment and we are presenting this idea further below.A recently published editorial in the August 2016 edition of Trends in Biotechnology by Epstein and Vermeire (2016) confirmed the conclusions of our meeting with Dr Woods.As devices designed in synthetic biology often work in a specific host context, it was deemed rational to design our devices in the organism most likely to be used in a final deployment of a minimum viable product.The purpose of each level is to stimulate the User to consider their attitudes towards novel applications for our technology.Due to the time constraints on this project, we were not able to utilise this part of our project to gather further data to inform our design.We identified that the design of the breadboard and other hardware components/devices (e.g., microfluidics) would require the use of \u0091environmentally unfriendly\u0092 materials such as plastics.This decision was made because there has been much research done on the design of genetic safeguards in E. coli, such as essential gene regulation (Kong et al.Considering that one of the envisioned applications of our device was the creation of an educational tool for children, we would want to ensure that our synthetically modified construct is:Non-pathogenic and not capable of having undesirable consequences (e.g.(2015) proved that it is possible to generate a translational and recombination  safeguard  mechanism in S. cerevisiae, akin to the generation of \u0091next-gen\u0092 methods stated above.Although we may not consider the ethical rights of yeast to be an issue currently, this was also the same for animal rights at one point, too.A further issue that Dr Woods mentioned was the possible issues of biocontainment and biosecurity.The current implementation of our thought experiment can be found under the thought experiment section.Dr Woods highlighted, however, that we do need to consider the public opinion to specific applications, rather than the technology itself.choice of chassis, methods of GM) and the ends (intended use of the tool).Furthermore, they were very keen to ensure that designs for any packaging were colourful.In order to interact with fellow iGEM teams and members of the public we decided to create a Facebook and Twitter page at the start of our project.However, we received positive feedback from a range of stakeholders towards the thought experiment simulator, and we would use this as a part of further research into this area.As the genetically engineered organism (GMO) is unable to transcribe and/or translate the synthetic amino acid, it is fully dependant upon exogenous synthetic amino acids from its growth media.Cai et al.The EU stance on GM is comparatively much stricter than the US and Asia, resulting in limitations to the potential deployment of our product.Box 3 of the editorial (Epstein and Vermeire, 2016) summarised the six key \u0091research recommendations  of three separate Scientific Committees of the European Commission (EC) on SynBio.PETA).Although we had not expected or considered this as a potential issue, it did make us consider whether this trend was likely to continue in the future.If at the beginning of the last century there were experiments made even on human subjects (and not always with their full consent), nowadays there are stringent regulations regarding experimentation involving humans and animals.In the current version, each level relates to an application of bio-electronics.A \u0091next-generation\u0092 biocontainment method for E. coli is being developed concurrently by Mandell et al.Moreover, public opinion is stronger supported by the activist groups (e.g.It was noted that, while there are no specific rules and regulations that apply to synthetic biology within the European Union (EU), a 2012 report by an EU Working Group noted current GMO directives (2000/608/EC, 2001/18/EC, and 2009/41/EC) are sufficient for this purpose.", "modeling": "Although we expect our construct to behave as in this latter simulation we will need to verify this empirically.Because our components are to be integrated into electrical circuits, we needed a way of modelling how their resistances would affect other circuit components as well as a means of determining the current though, and voltage across, each of the components as this effects the heat dissipated in the component as a result of the Joule effect.After some research we settled on using \u0091analysis by superposition\u0092 as our circuit analysis technique.Unfortunately they are not complex enough to capture aspects liek the cooling effect of the surrounding air on the components which limites the accuracy of our model somewhat and can lead to incorrect data in the simulator.Figure 14: Multiphysics temperature model of our microfluidics chambers.Given more time we would have tried to include some of these aspects in our simulator or found a way to include data from external programs like COMSOL which we were able to use to perform this more sophisticated analysis.We chose to build a UI for our models using HTML so that other people could explore the ways our technology would work in an easy way.In our construct this is L-arabinose, but from a modelling perspective, all that needs to change is the promoter strength.As with our previous models, there are transcription and translation rate constants that directly control the amount of protein synthesised.Note that a larger time step was used to clearly show that the amount of free and bound protein diverge over time.Figure 3: Free and bound zinc concentrations diverging over time, shown in our model.In our construct, we would expect that the expression of the output signal would remain low until the amount of 434 repressor was greater than the amount of lambda repressor at which point there would be a spike in the output signal which would decay as the repressors do.At this point we realised that to date, we had been modelling only a single cell when we need to be modelling populations of cells to see our desired effects on the correct scale.For our zinc model this is a simple matter of multiplying the single cell model to reflect the behavior of a whole population.Or modelling having a direct impact on our design work.As some of our parts are based on exploiting the the heat-shock response of E. coli it is important that we be able to determine the temperature change over time for our components.The concentration of CheZ in a typical cell is ~4-12 \u00b5M; this equates to between 4000 and 12000 proteins which is higher than the values we currently use in our model.Assuming that eventually all of the proteins bind the zinc, our population can remove zinc ions from the solution.We hope that our \u0091simulator\u0092 will demonstrate how our genetic constructs could fit into an electronic circuit.The core of our simulator features a set of ODEs that describe an abstract version of the transcriptional (Equation 1) and translational (Equation 2) processes in a cell.The two equations at the core of our simulator, describing transcription and translation.The rate at which these processes occur is controlled by a number of paramters, and .It is for this reason that we chose to use multiphysics modelling in our design work.We created models of the geometry of various containers we had available to use in our lab and then began investigating the physical properties of bacterial growth media.As you would expect the current is the same all the way through the circuit.We checked this analysis by modelling the same circuit in an existing circuit simulator as shown here, where we got the same results.Figure 12: Our worked example circuit (Figure 11) modelled using existing software, CircuitJS by Iain Sharp.You can also see the same circuit in our very own simulator implementing this technique.Figure 13: Our worked example circuit (Figure 11) modelled using our worked software.We used multiphysics modelling through the COMSOL software to inform the design of our physical hardware.Circuit analysis by superposition considers each voltage source at a time (\u0091shorting\u0092 out the others) and then summing the resulting voltage values to get the final voltage drop for all components.Before we could perform our analysis we needed to decide on our representation of our circuits.In other words, our present systems are not complex enough to warrant modelling at a lower level of abstraction in the simulator.That is not to say that we didn\u0092t also perform lower level modelling.Using what we learnt in our physics modelling using COMSOL we knew we could approximate the temperature rise from the Joule heating effect using the power dissipated in the component and the thermal conductivity of the media (which we determined with the help of the Exeter iGEM team).For our models we use and .Namely, that the number of proteins in the cell gradually increases up to some carrying capacity at which point they degrade at the same rate as they are produced and the amount of protein in the cell levels off.Figure 6: The expected  levelling-off  behaviour present in our capacitor model.Repressor 2 inhibits transcription from Promoter 2 and is induced by Inducer 2.Figure 5: SBOL Visual Diagram of the Design of our pH Toggle Switch Device.To toggle the expression of lacZ we chose a TetR/LacI scheme as this had been shown to be effective in previous iGEM projects like Wageningen 2014.As our chamber holds approximately 2 ml, we will use an estimated population size of of cells.Using our population scale model we observe that the concentration of free zinc is not reduced enough to have any impact on the conductivity.We came up with another ODE to model the amount of bound zinc.The above equation is a variant of the protein production equation, , which captures that every time step, the free SmtA binds with some efficiency to the free zinc ions.It is easy to adapt the model to this behaviour, as this is the same technique we use to model the addition of L-arabinose.Figure 9: The correct simulated behaviour of our biological capacitor construct.At this stage, we would expect our output protein to be produced as 434 repressor would out compete lambda repressor and prevent transcription of the output protein.We tried different approaches to modelling this change.In our modelling we focus only on variation in the and parameters; we can fluctuate these values various promoter strengths and protein degradation tags.Because the conductivity is known for a variety of concentrations, we can relate this the number of free ions using the molecular weight of zinc sulfate (zinc sulfate decomposes to and in solution).In this variant of the model we used a \u0091lottery\u0092 system to decide the transcriptional rate of the output protein.For this reason, our simulation uses sane defaults for the transcription rate, , which is analogous to promoter strength.When researching how we would construct our system we determined that the most straightforward of modelling our system in JavaScript without using any libraries or complex dependencies was to hard-code the ODEs.Another aspect that makes the ODEs approach useful for us is that the level of abstraction they capture i.e., transcription and translation, corresponds directly with the level at which we design our BioBrick constructs.However, we believe that this doesn\u0092t subtract from the quality of our models because their intended purpose is to encourage the user to think about the implications of interfacing bacteria with electronics rather than providing detailed models.And vice versa, the simulations at this level translate directly to components in the system which we can control in our constructs.Our model is a simplified view of the system as it ignores cellular mechanics, like the rate of zinc transport into and out of the cell.For the electrolyte we chose to model this as zinc sulfate as this is a common electrolyte for which the conductivity data is well known (CRC Handbook of Chemistry, 1989).If we wanted to be able to remove all the zinc we would need to start with a solution.In turn we felt that it was necessary to support the aims of the iGEM wiki system in preventing \u0091bit-rot\u0092, that is not having some aspects of our project hosted somewhere else where their uptime could not be guaranteed.We set a target of 30V as this can be safely produced in the lab using the bench top power supplies usually used for running gel electrophoresis experiments.Or modelling told us that to achieve our 30V goal we would have to switch to a micofluidics scale.Since there will always be leaky constitutive production, the addition of an inducer simple increases the strength, and the addition of a repressor decreases the strength of the promoter.In our model because 434 and lambda repressor are under the control of the same promoter they effectively share a transcripton rate which corresponds to the strength of that promoter.Again we can check that our total voltage drop matches the voltage supplied in the circuit, ?.Step 3: Finally we can derive any of the other data we need using the voltage drop through each component along with other equations.Onve armed with this information and the physical properties of our container materials which could be found in the COMSOL library we were able to model the temperature change in growth media.We used a number of libraries to aid our development, including jQuery UI to allow for drag and drop circuit construction, the Spectre.css CSS framework for basic page layout and, Chart.js to show the output from our models.Figure 15: Screenshot of bacterial lightbulb and power source in our simulator.You can try out more circuits in our editor to see the effect of using a bacterial resistor among other things.Blindauer, C. A., Harrison, M. D., Robinson, A. K., Parkinson, J.We think that this is similar to having the promoter for the output be \u0091weak\u0092, while having it be \u0091strong\u0092 when there is more 434 than lambda repressor.While the bound zinc in this model followed an expected trend, closely following the amount of protein produced, it fluctuated between the trend and zero every 500 or so time steps.The other parameters are unrelated to any of the elements of our system that we control.If on the other hand, the interaction between the lambda and 434 repressor behaves as in the stochastic simulation then our construct will not work as expected.For example, we can directly influence the number of proteins in the cell by increasing the number of coding sequences on a construct.On this page, we discuss the ordinary differential equation (ODE) modelling of our components for use in a web-based \u0091simulator\u0092.Additionally, the node structure of the linked list allows the system to generalise to parallel circuits, which would be represented by a graph data structure if at a later date we choose to implement this functionality.The algorithm for analysing such circuits is simple, and is illustrated in the worked example below.Step 1: Short each voltage source in turn and compute the voltage across the resistors.Shorting the 1.5V source leaves only the 9V source, the voltage across each resistor can then be found using the voltage divider formula: .We can check our answers make sense by seeing that they sum to , ?.Shorting the 9V source leaves the 1.5V source.This happens at the same rate as the protein degradation in the standard model.You\u0092ll observe that at this point we\u0092ve started to differentiate between bound and unbound proteins, but our model does not currently capture this.We wanted our model to reflect the zinc binding and release over time through the synthesis of SmtA, a metallothionein from Cyanobacteria.We also constrain the other parameters in our simulator so that the simulation is stable when the user is given control over these values.Where K is the thermal conductivity (for LB broth this is ), L is the length and A is the area of the container.We also looked at using where and is the specfic heat capacity, which we know for LB is similar to water ().In reality it may not be the case that the degradation tag results in a 2x speed up in degradation but this can be accomodated in the model.We changed the promoter from strong to weak using the values outlined in the \u0091simulator core\u0092 section.Figure 7: Behaviour of the system when the promoter is weakened at t=4000.This is because pH is a measure of the number of H+ ions in solution and it is these ions, among others, that conduct current.Time is shown in seconds (s).When we connected this with our conductivity model, however, we noticed that the conductivity was not affected.The way the lottery system works is that each protein is given a number of \u0091tickets\u0092 in direct proportion to the total amount of protein that exists.This initial modelling told us that it was indeed possible to get our desired temperature change of 10\u00b0C from the joule effect.Developing our multiphysics model further we were able to establish which voltages and currents would cause our desired temperature change.At this point we had to call upon the assistance of another iGEM team, team Exeter to help determine the specific heat capacity of different growth media such as M9 and LB as we did not have the equipment available to conduct the studies ourselves.However, in the final construct, this protein would ideally be the protein that causes the capacitor to charge so that they could be chained together.The output signal follows the same trend as the lambda and 434 repressor, but with a large amount of noise.This is counter to our goal as a foundational advance team to enable as many people as possible to explore our technology.Because we had developed a model we were able to alter the parameters and see if we could reduce the required voltage.That is, for each time step compute where h is the step size, f is a differential equation such as those above.For demonstrative purposes of showing we can partially mimic this behaviour, we assume that the signal is applied constitutively and then switched off by the addition of a chemical.This is an important part of being a foundational advance team, showing how our technologies could be used.To speed up development our UI was constructed around the existing JavaScript models, which we ported from the above MATLAB models and tied to an integrator which is always running in the background.The best data we could find was on the concentration of CheZ in a typical cell, since this is a natural E. coli protein (with a role in chemotaxis) rather than an engineered expression system the values may not correspond well with our expression system.This creates a linear circuit like the figure below.Figure 10: Illustration of the circuit level abstraction we are using in our model.Computationally we build our circuits as linked lists for easy traversal and simple editing operations.Time is shown in seconds (s).As can be seen in Figure 6, the stochastic model results in leaky behaviour.We had difficulty finding protein expression quantified in this way as expression levels are usually determined using a reporter protein like GFP and the level given in arbitrary fluorescence units (e.g.For example, it might be logical for the user to select between a weak, medium or strong promoter.This leads us to hypothesise that the cell is unnecessary, on the condition that SmtA remains stable outside of the cell.From this observation we developed some additional variants of our variable resistor construct that would allow us to purify the SmtA and examine this question experimentally.The following set of ODEs mathematically describe the system:Since our construct contains twice as many coding sequences for 434 repressor as lambda repressor its concentration increases twice as fast which is reflected in the above equations.This is largely due to the fact that bacterial growth media are largely water, which has a high specific heat capacity which makes it good for cooling applications but not so good for heating.Therefore, lower pH solutions have both a higher concentration of H+ ions and higher conductivity.Altering the resistance in this way has the advantage that even if we were unable to measure resistance we knew we could still integrate this with electronics.At the same time, some of the currently bound proteins are degraded, releasing four zinc ions each.Time is shown in seconds (s).As can be seen in Figure 7, the 434 repressor quickly decays to the point where there is more lambda repressor than 434 repressor.Each protein that binds removes four zinc ions (we later chose to factor our this constant as a variable so that we could explore the impact that a better zinc binding protein would have).Figure 6 shows the behaviour of the system when the promoter is weakened at .We used the available data from the literature to fit an equation relating conductivity to the number of free zinc ions.One that the user might control with a simple slider for example.That is, the current through R1 is and through R2 is .As shown in Figure 1, the resulting equation was .This can easily be simulated using the proportion of each protein to allocate tickets on the line 0-1 and then using a random number from 0 to 1 to determine the winner.This new model resulted in the expected behaviour, shown in Figure 3.We thought this might be a consequence of our model having too low protein expression, ~1400 proteins per cell.The rest of this page will discuss how the other components were simulated using this technique and then integrated into the simulator.However this remains a challenge as the Urease protein is very complex (5 kb of DNA encoding 7 genes).As with all our models the biological capacitor is built around the core equations for transcription and translation.The joule effect is the heating caused when power is dissipated in a resistor.In the future we wold like to further augment this design with a mechanism for reducing the pH in the off state, for example through Urease production.Consequently to simulate the addition of a repressor in our model we need only vary the value of this transcriptional constant.Note that the voltage is positive even though the source is after the resistor because it is \u0091dragging up\u0092 the ground.As such it can be generalized to any number of protein expressions by having a tuple for each gene product in the model and separate counts of mRNA and protein.This gave us an equation that we can use to map a user\u0092s idea of \u0091promoter strength\u0092 to a transcription rate.In this scheme the addition of aTC to the medium inhibits the off signal (tetR expression) causing the on signal (lacI) and reporter to be expressed, this is the  on  state.This efficiency is modeled as the constant which is the percentage of the free proteins that bind each time step.we achieved this feat using the same methodology to that of our original model that had zinc binding modelled directly.The number of bound zinc ions can easily be found by multiplying the number of bound proteins by 4.This allows us to have multiple voltage sources in our circuit which is important as we want to be able to mix microbial fuel cell sources and standard DC sources like batteries and see the effect.When we investigated alternative ways to change a mediums resistance we found that pH and conductivity (the reciprocal of resistivity) are intrinsically related.Figure 2: This was done so that we could quickly get graphical output from our models and thereby assess their validity.Our variable resistor works by varying the concentration of free zinc in an electrolyte in order to control the resistance.Primarily, this was ease of development and integration into the iGEM wiki system.In this scenario, the user should not be required to know the exact numerical values of their choice.For example, it would not allow the user to see the variation in gene product caused by slight noise in the promoter strength value, e.g.This makes it easy to translate between formats and allows for us to rapidly add new knowledge to the simulator as we develop our constructs.The simplest is to iteratively compute the difference and add these to a \u0091running total\u0092 over the lifetime of the simulation.When lacZ is expressed the E. coli can metabolise lactose in their growth media, this results in acid production which lowers the pH of the growth media and thereby also lowers the resistance.Figure 4: The basic toggle switch of Gardner et al.For our biological capacitor the only extension upon our existing model base is that instead of keeping track of one protein we have to keep track of three: lambda repressor, 434 repressor, and a reporter protein.We also used rule-based modelling in the BioNetGen language using the RuleBender graphical tool.(2000) as shown in figure 4 by adding lacZ as the reporter (figure 5).We would be able to do this using readily available pH sensors which we knew about due to our discussions with Luis Ortiz at IWBDA 2016 who was working with this technique.We adapted the basic genetic toggle switch design of Gardner et al.Where and are parameters found by our equation fitting ().At time there is some amount of ions, in our model this is .Consequently, we have assigned these fixed values in our simulator.Since our code is freely available, a modeller with different simulation requirements could easily change these parameters if they were meaningful in their scenario.This results in the following behaviour in the system.Figure 8: The simulated behaviour of the biological capacitor using stochastic approach.Our main aim was to allow the simulator to be embedded in the wiki.This allowed us to capture our systems in more detail and to \u0091sanity check\u0092 the simplified models we use here in our simulator.There are a number of ways to integrate the differential equations presented above.In layman s terms, no biological promoter can be completely \u0091switched off\u0092.Figure 1: Trend line and equation fitted to our promoter scale.The remainder of our simulator is built around these simple equations.And to see the corresponding affect on the conductivity.Rather than accumulating charge, the capacitor accumulates proteins that are used to drive an output when the input signal stops being applied.Source: Wikipedia.Before adding our constructs to the simulator we first developed the models in MATLAB.It is, therefore, more accurate at small step sizes (the global error is proportional to the step size and the local error is proportional to the square of the step size).The addition of IPTG on the other hand causes the repression of the on signal (lacI), allowing expression of the off signal (tetR) which inhibits the further expression of the reporter.",

Protocol provided by Dr Ed Milner, Dr Paniz Izadi and Professor Ian Head.", "result": "In order to do so, we looked at the work carried out by the 2011 Tokyo-NokoGen iGEM team who used the smtA gene from Cyanobacteria and inserted it into a strain of E. coli.We designed two parts (BBa_K1895000 and BBa_K1895006) which respond to the heat-stress in two different ways:BBa_K1895000 contains the E. coli htpG promoter.This composite part also contains a modified BioBrick compatible ?32 coding region (the gene rpoH, BBa_K1895001) which will create a positive feedback loop to the PhtpG promoter, therefore increasing the expression of the downstream reporter gene sfGFP and the fluorescence of the cell.BBa_K1895006 contains the dnaK promoter which, like PhtpG, is transcribed via binding of RNA polymerase by ?32.We took the smtA gene, (BBa_K519010), and put it under the control of a PBAD promoter, induced by the presence of L-arabinose, making our BioBrick BBa_K1895999.This should allow us to control the uptake of zinc ions by adding or removing L-arabinose, resulting in control over the resistance of the LB media.We aimed to look at different ways of improving the voltage output of a microbial fuel cell.PdnaK is placed upstream of the BBa_0034 RBS and BBa_I746916 sfGFP.We aimed to create a biological \u0093variable resistor\u0094 by modifying the E. coli\u0092s natural systems to allow for controlled ion uptake.Bielefeld also had issues with cell growth due to the metabolic stress of using a T7 promoter.One of the issues we noticed with their design was that their porin overexpression protein was taken from Pseudomonas fluorescens and so the pores size was too large for the E. coli to handle.At first we looked at yeast microbial fuel cells with the help of Dr Ed Milner, Dr Paniz Izadi and Professor Ian Head, but after talking with PEALS we decided to move away from using yeast and looked at working with E. coli instead.", "safety": "If the response to any of these is yes, then a further assessment of the risks posed by the design needs to be performed.Is the chassis organism from a risk group other than Class 1 (bacteria) or may it be harmful (non bacterial chassis)?Are any of the coding sequences from risk group 2 organisms?Would the system enable the dissemination of genetic material?Are any of the coding sequences used sourced from places other than the iGEM registry?We answered these for all of our constructs and found the only construct that needed further risk assessment was our controlled OrpF expression device (BBa_K1895005).We settled on the following list of criteria:The first set of questions should be answered negatively for any of our designs to ensure that we meet our safety aims and those of iGEM.Do any of the coding sequences for proteins in the design come from organisms listed as hazardous or are found in Risk Group 3 or 4?Are any of the coding sequences from virulence factors, or would they mimic the behaviour of an existing virulence factor?We then examine if the design might pose any additional risks by considering the following questions.Additionally, the gene product, the porin itself has no potential for dual use and is not harmful to the environment in any way.Although we assessed this coding sequence to be safe for use in our designs, we have chosen to assign risk group 2 status to E. coli transformed with plasmids containing constructs which contain this gene and express the OprF protein.Additionally, in cases such as the microbial fuel cell, we are explicitly trying to reduce the metabolic strain on the cell which would not be helped by adding a kill switch system.After further consideration of this issue we identified an alternative safety system which functions along similar principles to a \u0091kill switch\u0092 and which could easily be integrated into our systems to make the safer.We found that we did not as we use only non-red flagged registry parts or coding sequences from the list of dangerous categories.Completed the \u0091About Our Project\u0092 questionnaire.As a UK based team we familiarised ourselves with the regulations in the UK concerning the proper safe management of biological organisms, and particularly GMOs.To assess this risk we identified a number of \u0091mitigating factors\u0092 that would minimise the risk posed by using this sequence.The protein we are dealing with is well characterised.The protein does not play a role in toxicity or virulence.The protein will only be produced at high levels in growth media containing L-arabinose.Based on these, we believe that the risk from using this sequence is negligible and so continued with this design.The organism, protein and risk group for parts not from E. coli are given in the table below.As one of the organisms we use is a risk group 2 organism, it was important that we closely reviewed the coding sequence we intended to use.This is a high chance of failure which we are working to mitigate using alternative materials in the construction of our chambers (plastic rather than PDMS).The effect of a physical containment failure is low, the volumes of E. coli (0.1ml) involved are easily contained in the laboratory (which is where we intend our devices to be used) and the cells can be lysed with 70% ethanol.This means the main techniques we used to manage our risk when using these was wearing the appropriate PPE (such as nitrile gloves and lab coats) and proper disinfection of surfaces and equipment before and after use with ChemGene and 70% ethanol during our project.As our work involves genetic modification, we end up with \u0091new\u0092 organisms and so we are responsible for assigning them a risk group.If our physical containment fails then E. coli will be able to enter the environment, from a risk perspective this is a \u0091failure\u0092 regardless of the rate or amount of bacteria that leak.For this reason, we further investigated ways in which we could improve the safety of our system.In investigating how we could further increase the safety of our transformed organisms we came across the use of genetic kill switches which have been investigated by a number of iGEM teams in the past, e.g.It can then be assigned a risk category using a risk assessment matrix.Figure 1: The risk matrix we use to assess the risks in our project.The Paris Bettencourt 2012 iGEM team have shown how the likelihood of a physical containment failure can be estimated.The protein also has a structural role in regulating cell shape and the cell s ability to grow in low-osmolarity medium.We assess this as being a safe to use protein coding sequence as it does not fall into one of the dangerous categories listed in the safety guidelines, nor when we consulted the database of virulence factors for Pseudomonas\u00a0did we find the gene for this protein indicated.As we do not have time to test such as system as part of our own work we located an existing experiment in the literature to serve as a proof of concept for this scheme.This legislation is summarised in documents by the UK Health & Safety Executive.In essence we determined that the aim of these regulations is to:identify the hazards and assessing the risks to health arising from the use of hazardous substances during a work activity.decide what control measures are required to prevent or control exposureensure that control measures are properly implemented and maintainedmonitor the exposure of users to hazardous substances if appropriateproviding information, instruction and training to users of hazardous substances to ensure safe working practices and competencyensuring sufficient arrangements to deal with any accidents, incidents and emergencies that are reasonably foreseeableWe also familiarised ourselves with our Institution s biological risk assessment policy\u00a0and chemical risk assessment policy\u00a0to ensure we completed our risk assessments correctly when required.It is often said in Synthetic Biology that the emergent behaviour of genetic systems are often not immediately obvious.We found that we did not as our two organisms E. coli K-12, and S. cerevisiae were on the white list.We checked the components of our parts against the white list to see if we needed to complete a check in.We discuss the further steps we took to minimise the risk when working with this organism in the section on safe lab work.The other main risk we identified for our project is physical containment failure.Any work involving this plasmid and transformed products will be confined to our level 2 biosafety laboratory.None of the proteins in our constructs can be found on the Australia group list for export control\u00a0or the US list of select agents\u00a0so we do not anticipate any issues shipping our freeze-dried plasmid DNA to iGEM HQ.The line with squares in graph B shows that there is reduced growth of the mutants when no supplements are present.In the future we suggest that our constructs be used in bacteria with this or a similar mutation to improve the safety of our system.This serves to supplement our physical containment strategy.Whilst considering the risks posed by our physical container, it occurred to us that we needed to also consider more general impact of creating a physical product such as our plug \u0091n\u0092 play kit on the environment and users.).From a biological safety perspective the most important risk management practices depend on the risk group of the organism you are working with.Additionally, because we are working with genetically modified organisms (GMOs)\u00a0our work is subject to The Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2014\u00a0which is the legislation implementing the European directive on on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms.Refer to the OpenWetWare page on E. coli strains for more information.Such a dependency system is summarised in  Building-in biosafety for synthetic biology ; (Wright, Stan & Ellis, 2013) and does not appear to have any negative impacts on the bacteria in our use case.We will supply information on how to remove the PDMS and this recycling information alongside our kit.As part of our laboratory induction which took place during the first week of our project we were introduced to the General Safety Procedures for working in our labs.Consequently, responsible design is an important part of synthetic biology, so as part of our design work we decided upon a set of criteria which we would use to assess each design for risk.The work by Cranenburgh (2001), \u0091Escherichia coli strains that allow antibiotic-free plasmid selection and maintenance by repressor titration\u0092 shows that ?dapD mutants suffer low growth without supplements (in this case IPTG as dapD was placed under the control of the lac promoter).In our experiments measuring the temperature effects in the chamber we found that 1 in 10 chambers failed in use.Therefore for us, the likelihood of a physical failure is related to the chance of our microfluidics chambers leaking.In order to assess this risk, we need to know both the consequence and likelihood of the risk occurring.This risk group is assigned depending on the components that were used in making the new organism.Fortunately, when we consulted the UniProt entry for OprF (ID: PORF_PSEAE) we found that this protein is well characterised, with experimental evidence at the protein level.We checked our organisms against the white list to see if we needed to complete a check-in.There was a focus on microbiological safety, and, as we would be working in both class 1 and class 2 biological safety level labs, the differences for working in each.In keeping with best practices, we will be recording and tracking all the parts we ship.That is, the notation of \u0091dependent bacteria\u0092.", "keywords": "Plastiback

light-switchable two-component systems as the signal input, and intended to rely on three commonly used ones: red, blue, and green [1].The software provides two operating modes: the E.coli-code mode is able to convert any given information into light-coded files, and therefore turn these files into actual light-exposure commands of the E-light hardware system.This year we the team Tsinghua 2015 attempt to store biological information into E. coli by combining the light system with the gene editing tools.Using this screening system, we can also determine the optimal distance between sgRNA pairs and length of the linker.With the assistance from the software, we can either convert a file into the binary data string which can be transformed to a light emitting pattern with a coding protocol (a pre-programmed grammar), in turn being encoded into the bacteria by a modified recombinase, or we can put in light parameters and encrypt the information into the bacteria.With the help from structural biology, we in the future might know how this system works in the end.With the help of the coding-plasmids from our CRISPR-Recombinase system, we can eventually store any information into the E.coli DNA and of course, extract the information later on through sequencing.The E-light 1.0 hardware system has 3 major components: the light-exposure & bacterial culture system, the controlling circuit and the computer interacting port.For the Cas9-recombinase system, we designed an iPTG-inducible ccdB screening system to test whether its gene editing ability is powerful or not.We took advantage of the high precision and programmability of light system and the specificity and the convenience from a Cas9-recombinase hybrid.Thus, combined with our light-switch, the user is able to gain better control over the bacteria\u0092s metabolism pathways.With this information storage platform in hand, what can we do in the future?The controlling circuit utilizes 3 AT89S52-24PU DIP-40 SCMs (single chip microcomputer) to execute programmed-controlling of the 24 tri-color LEDs, while the computer interacting port monitors the whole system through given protocol sequences.Green-light system do not represent none of two types of binary information, instead it acts as a license that allows the recombines to work [4].The E-code 1.0 software system aims to provide convenient commanding for users of the E-light hardware system.For the Cas9-recombinsae system we selected recombinase system as the tool to edit the gene due to its specificity for consensus sequences.Adding NOT and OR gates downstream the light system might render the system more complex and therefore available for better information storing capacity.We also would be able to develop better encoding algorithm to integrate more information into the bacterial genome and in a more versatile way.In order to build an information storage platform described above we devised a hardware assisted by a software that can eventually convert any form of profile into biological meaningful information.It is not hard to imagine a world where you can simply store any kind of digital information you want into the bacteria, and break the storing limitation of general electrical device.In order to utilize the light as an input signal, we have to first test its basic parameters which can be refer to.For example, we can denote the blue-light system to control information containing \u00930\u0094 whereas the red-light system to control information containing \u00931\u0094.With more delicate design and further investigation into this system, we can take our platform onto a whole new level.We adapted an engineering strategy onto these two component system by combining different modules and components from different species in order to achieve highest efficiency [2].We additionally built a model of the relationship between the light input and the protein expression output based on previous results.All being said, we still needed to first determine the basic parameter of this inducible system.Again, qualitative and quantitative experiments are carried out, turning out to be promising to ensure that inducible system can work successfully in E. coli.A straightforward strategy is to use light-switchable two-component system to directly control the gene-editing hybrid.We received quite convincing results to support that light-switchable two-component system can work successfully in E. coli.At present our system can theoretically encode and encrypt any form of file and convert their binary data stream into biological meaningful information, i.e.The light-exposure & bacterial culture system is based on a 24-well plate coupled with tri-color LEDs.We therefore complemented this system by utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 system, because it is guided by a sgRNA pair that is not limited to specific sequences.Given the ideas come up with above, how can we put all parts together in order to store information within the E. coli?Using smaller Cas9 endonuclease is also a must when considering transforming the entire plasmid into the bacteria, which is actually a metabolic burden for the cell.[2] Tabor J J, Levskaya A, Voigt C A. Multichromatic control of gene expression in Escherichia coli[J].Genetically engineered light sensors for control of bacterial gene expression[J].", "design": "The green-light system works an extremely similar way to that of the blue light system: it is comprised of two essential components, a light sensor and a response regulator.The red-light system used in our project consists of two components, a membrane-bound light sensor Cph8 and a response regulator OmpR [3].Light-switchable two-component system (TCS) is one example of how light signal can be wired into the metabolic pathway within the bacteria [3].Additionally, there are two components within: a light sensor and a response regulator, the former sensing the incoming light and responding to it by changing the conformation, the latter reacting to the sensor and turning on or off the gene expression due to its transcriptional factor nature.The principle behind light-switchable two-component system goes like this: When a beam of light hits on the bacteria, the effector module in the sensor, i.e., the HK domain, will change its confirmation accordingly, therefore its catalytic activity transits from a phosphokinase to a phosphatase.In this system, a J? chain is introduced to link the light sensor and effector together, of which the conformation change is induced, switching the YF1 (the fusion protein) from a kinase to a phosphatase.The blue-light-sensitive LOV domain in its soluble light sensor YF1 is derived from a protein termed YtvA from B. subtilis, whereas the histidine kinase domain derived from the protein FixL and the response regulator FixJ are found B. japonicum.As a result, a recombinase system is the most ideal candidate when looking for an information storing executor.Thus, the response regulator, FixJ, is dephosphorylated and deprived of the ability to drive FixK2-promotor-regulated gene expression [3].Since that there is an endogenous expression level of red-light system in E. coli, a bacterial knock-out technique is introduce to avoid a potentially confusing result [4].To be more specific, a light sensor is made up of two modules: an actual light sensor and an effector which possesses both kinase and phosphatase activity.As a result, RR cannot recognize its downstream target sequence and cannot activate the expression of the reporter gene.As is indicated by its nomenclature, this system is switchable \u0096 it has two interchangeable states when stimulated by different light conditions.With the advancement of gene editing technology, today CRISPR/Cas9 system has been exploited to carry out a myriad of functions, such as knock-out and knock-down of a certain gene, single molecule imaging, etc.It turns out that the inducible ccdB system works perfectly well, so it is competent to be used to screen the optimal distance between sgRNA pairs and an appropriate linker choice.Cas9, an endonuclease from Streptococcus pyogenes, can target and cleave specific DNA sequences that are next to the proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM) when provided with a guide RNA.Different light systems generally do not interfere with each other, and therefore can be stimulated and silenced in parallel [2].Here, however, the light sensor module is designated as Cyb, along with its histidine kinase, constituting the light sensor component CcaS.The light sensor is made up of a red-light-sensitive cyanobacterial phytochrome sensor module Phy derived from a protein called Cph1 from S. PCC 6803, and a histidine kinase domain from a protein called EnvZ from E. coli.Generally, two families of recombinase have been identified: the tyrosine recombinase and the serine recombinase [5].Genetically engineered light sensors for control of bacterial gene expression[J].In this way, precise gene editing and information storing can be achieved by utilizing the light system to regulate the dCas9-recombinase hybrid.In addition, the inducible ccdB system has other potential future applications.That is to say, we still count on the specificity and accuracy of recombinase, but meanwhile we need the assistance from Cas9.We established a model of the inducible ccdB system indicating the relationship between iPTG addition and OD value after discussing parameters of iPTG, ccdB, relative concentration of bacteria, and OD value measured.After successfully constructing all the systems required and confirming its efficacy, we can bridge the light-switchable TCS and the dCas9-recombines system together.CRISPR-Cas9 system is a newly developed gene-editing tool that breaks the limit of specific recognition sites.Consequently it is regarded as a complementary DNA cutter that is not restricted to recognize unique sequences, but is versatile that can recognize any sequence within the genome guided by its sgRNA.This means that if current information storage capacity is not enough, we do not need to search for a new recombinase, instead changing the sgRNA pairs can solve the problem.Engineering Escherichia colito see light[J].Therefore, if we have to choose one form of signal as the input, the optical input is favored [1].A pair of sgRNAs targeting the sense and antisense strand of the DNA sequence guide the fusion protein to the location, and the recombinase part of the fusion protein carries out deletion or inversion of the DNA segment.The blue light system follows similar principles, containing two components as well.Of course, it is easy to understand why we then turn to Cas9 and see if it can overcome the specificity issue from recombinase issue [6].There are two commonly used gene-editing tools: site-specific recombinase and CRISPR-Cas9 system.Following the guidance of sgRNAs, Cas9 endonuclease can be used to modify any site of the genome conveniently.Along ccdB\u0092s sequence we designed 25 and 24 sgRNAs targeting each strand of the DNA.However, accurate deletion or inversion, a vital aspect to consider when devising an information storing platform, are hard to accomplish because of double-strand breaks introduced by Cas9 endonuclease.With this new tool we don\u0092t need to bother considering and introducing recognition sites of the recombinases anymore.Also, without causing double-strand breaks, gene editing can be safer and more accurate [6].In other words, a major drawback of this information-storing platform is that every time a new recombinase has to be used when increasing the storing capability.[1] Tabor J J, Levskaya A, Voigt C A. Multichromatic control of gene expression in Escherichia coli[J].The response regulator is derived from OmpR of which the recognition site is a promoter named OmpC.Site-specific recombinase is an endonuclease that is capable of inserting, deleting and inverting a DNA fragment within the recognition site.In our system, three mainstream light systems we took advantage of all follow this basic scheme.Second, easy access and low cost renders light system frequently used.Effects of different designs of linkers are also tested using this inducible ccdB system.We built an inducible ccdB screening system for it.Refactoring and optimization of light-switchable Escherichia coli two-component systems[J].The sensor and the effector interact closely in order to give a precise light-induced response.Recombinases were previously utilized to accomplish information storage in biological systems due to its specificity [7].Although the screening work wasn\u0092t finished, a linker choice and distance between two sgRNAs worked finely.Three types of TCS are now the most commonly investigated, including red, blue and green light system, named by at which wavelength the system is responsive.Addition of iPTG induces expression of ccdB and then bacteria get killed, but if ccdB gene is successfully disrupted by dCas9 recombinase, then the bacteria survive.[7] Yang L, Nielsen A A K, Fernandez-Rodriguez J, et al.", "human_practice": "In addition to our telling the story of iGEM and some previous interesting projects, we encouraged them to form several temporary teams, which enabled them to exchange their preliminary ideas relevant to feasible iGEM projects.The most impressive part came when the representative of every group shared the amazing thoughts of their discussion, and those brave students were awarded with small souvenirs.The public we targeted to were mainly consisted of three groups listed below: students from other iGEM teams, freshmen from the School of Life Science in Tsinghua this year and some high school students who showed great interest in our project and daily experiment.Freshmen major in Biology always look forward to their research life in the future with enormous passion every year.At last, we received many reflections and encouragements written on the leaflet from them, which made us feel even more hopeful when thinking about future iGEM teams representing the School of Life Science in Tsinghua.In the light of this statement, we held an iGEM Mini-Jamboree on September 13th, 2015.In this way, efficient and harmonious communication between teams was realized while we got helpful advice at the same time.We decided to create a chance for high school students to experience experiments in the lab after we got to know

GFP, will be expressed when bacteria carrying this plasmid are provided with blue light.Add gradients of 0.1% iPTG to bacteria suspension.In this experiment, we used a recombinase system to insert a Kanamycin gene into the genomic region where we want to target and then utilized other recombinase to remove the Kanamycin gene.For the red light system, we transformed a plasmid containing the entire red light system (Cph8, HO1 and PcyA), along with a promoter, a terminator and an OmpR regulated reporter.Therefore, when bacteria carrying this gene are provided with the red light, the reporter cannot be synthesized.The result supported this prediction because we can observe a distinctive expression pattern between the treated (provided with red light) and untreated (kept in dark) group.Eventually, we successfully fused two proteins with the seamless cloning, as is supported by the appearance of 4-5kb bands in nearly all lanes.In addition, we added a roughly 36bp linker between the two in order to increase its flexibility.As can be seen in Figure 3, roughly 1kb bands appear nearly in every lane, supporting that our knock-out system was effective.In this experiment, we planned to fuse two proteins, a recombinase and a Cas9, together.(c) Measure OD600 value of each dilution of the suspension, using liquid LB as blank.", "safety": "Before we started our project, all of our team members had received lab safety training, including standard experimental protocols, disposal of waste, information on hazardous chemicals and proper use of biosafety cabinets etc.The risks to team members were minimized by wearing appropriate PPEs in the lab all the time and following lab safety regulations of Tsinghua University.In order to avoid that problem, all members in the team were instructed of how to distribute and utilize this gene with specific orientation.Since that ccdB is an inhibitor of DNA gyrase and therefore interferes with normal bacterial activity, any improper disposal of ccdB protein and plasmids containing ccdB gene will pose serious results to the natural bacterial communities.In addition, since that ccdB is not harmful for human beings, it is trustworthy and safe to use this protein to kill the bacteria.In one of our experimental design, a lethal protein ccdB was used to screen for successful dCas9-recombinase hybrid design.Therefore,

(NGG), attempts to match its sgRNA target sequence to the adjacent DNA strand and cleaves the DNA if it finds a match.To target a DNA sequence, a single guide RNA (sgRNA) is used to identify a match .This makes it possible to swap out a 20 base pair section of the sgRNA sequences, instead of synthesizing new targets from scratch, so there is no need to re-synthesize and re-clone the entire sgRNA sequence for each new target we d like to test.Since its popularization, CRISPR papers have flooded major journals and many iGEM teams have worked to improve its use as a genome editing tool.The 2015 Waterloo team is taking a three-pronged approach to expand upon previous research for wider, more efficient, and more flexible use of CRISPR-Cas9: easy testing of sgRNA designs with our Simple sgRNA Exchange design, applying research on new mutations in Cas9 s PAM-interacting domain to enable Cas9 PAM Flexibility and applying our work as a CRISPR Plant Defense protecting A. thaliana against

criteria for assessing the environmental safety of PNTs under directive 94-08: \u0091Assessment Criteria for Determining Environmental Safety of Plants with Novel Traits\u0092 The potential of the PNT to become a weed of agriculture or be invasive of natural habitatsThe potential for gene flow to sexually compatible plants whose hybrid offspring may become more weedy or more invasive The potential impact of the PNT or its gene products on non-target species, including humans  In Canada, Health Canada controls the sale of genetically engineered food or products by the guidelines under division 28 (of part B) of the food and drugs regulations.GM crops with insect resistant technology were a main focus following the initial commercialization of GM food products in 1996, and have more data on the their long-term effects .The goal for CRISPieR, as the technology becomes industrialized, is for it\u0092s safety to be granted unconfined environmental release; the release of the product into the environment with limited restrictions for commercialization .However, we would need to convince the Canadian Intellectual Property Office that our product only used the process outlined in US 8 697 359, that the product created with it is a significant improvement of the original, and contains novel DNA and/or proteins that are patentable under Canadian or American Law.The product would be a seed with the incorporated CRISPR-cas9 construct technology incorporated in it for immunity against CaMV virus.It could include extensive research concerning the safety and health side effects of consumption of the product.Step 3: A minimum of 45 days is required until it is decided whether the product is safe or requires additional information by the manufacturers.Substantial equivalence compares the environmental and human health safety of the PNT to its non-modified counterpart via phenotypic comparison and compositional analysis of the GM product with it\u0092s parent line, or a similar reference .However, a large debate still surrounds the safety of the technology.Short-term studies will be used to prove that nothing in the CRISPieR technology is inherently unsafe, a claim required for unconfined release where CRISPieR will be marketable until proven unsafe .In 2002, the Supreme Court of Canada denied a patent for a mouse which was modified to be oncogenic, despite it being granted in the US.The commercialization of CRISPieR technology requires examination of safety concerns for regulatory bodies as well as the general public.g-term testing or monitoring for PNTs is required in Canada.However, they felt it best not to add something else to their plate due to the ongoing patent dispute between the Broad Institute and the University of California,.No matter what the courts decide, these patents will expire in just under 20 years, after which a product such as ours will be free to produce without licensing with the Broad Institute, which currently holds the patent .Once the safety standards have been met, the product will be made available to farmers for mass production.Canada Banana Farms is a local farm in Wingham, Ontario which grows organic, non-GMO bananas and other tropical fruits.This diction appears to indicate that any modified CRISPR-cas9 system would fall under this patent and other labs that modify the system as the base pair level would not be able to patent this technology.CFIA conducts a safety review of the GM crop before approving the technology for feed safety.Viral resistance to the CRISPieR seeds is a variable that will need to be monitored.Independently of the place of origin of the product, genetic engineered products must be approved by Health Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection agency (CFIA) and Environment Canada.Apart from these ecological issues, unexpected outcomes may also be a result of potential pleiotropic effects from the additional vector in the plant.Highlights of the visit which have helped us understand human factors related to our project:The farm\u0092s priorities are centered on their customer\u0092s needs rather than a philosophical agenda.This exponential growth period, paired with the plethora of environmental variables, has resulted in a lack of long-term data that can provide unequivocal evidence in favour of GM crops.Be safe for consumption: The CRISPR technology should not introduce new toxins or allergens Be palatable: Consumers who purchase harvested produce must find the taste appealing, as well as visually and textualy identical, or improved, to the original organismThe Supreme Court of Canada has decided that specific genes and processes are patentable; however, the same is not the case for entire organisms.In Canada, genetically modified plants are listed under the \u0091Plants with Novel Traits\u0092 (PNT) category, and their regulation is governed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) .Moving beyond government regulation, the main safety concern of GM foods in the scientific community, is the unintended effects that can accompany genetic manipulation.The question for further short-term safety studies is whether the plasmid insert will have any adverse effects on the natural biological processes of the plant.Again however, they were unwilling to commit any answers at this point in the patenting process.Incidentally, were a patent to be granted for the agriculturally important Cassava, we would need our patent to be protected within the largest producer of Cassava, Nigeria.In light of a greater world population, Canada Banana Farms believes genetically modified foods will play an increasingly important role in the future of foods because greater harvests cannot be achieved otherwise.Print sources are an important resource for a farmer when making initial farming decisions, supplemented by good, personal relationships with experts.After this time, it may be possible to obtain a patent in Canada for the cells which are genetically modified using CRISPR, similar to the patent rights granted Monsanto Canada in Monsanto Canada Inc v. Schmeiser.The CRISPR-Cas9 system uses targeted nuclease activity to cleave viral DNA A main concern for its implementation would be off-target effects of the nuclease activity on the plant genome .The main critique for current safety assessment is the lack of consideration for these unintended effects caused by transgenic species .Currently, the regulatory approach overseeing this review only considers the final product, not the methods used to produce the PNT .Risk analysis conducted by CFIA uses the principle of \u0091Substantial Equivalence\u0092 and \u0091Familiarity\u0092, initially developed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development .Safety trials will be performed in greenhouses to ensure that the newly grown plants are indeed immune to the virus.When the seed itself is harvested, it will then be screened to ensure that the new seeds have the integrated technology.CRISPieR technology boasts secondary structural modifications that allows for easy reprograming of the sgRNA for this testing.Omic studies could be the first step in drawing data for this query.To obtain approval from such organizations a step by step process is followed and therefore outlined below:Information about the product must be submitted to the Food Directorate of Health Products and Food Branch, Health Canada.Since then, the courts allow stronger patents over biotechnology, though they still do not allow patenting of whole higher level organisms.The Broad Institute was issued the US patent 8 697 359 which talks about the CRISPR-cas9 technology.Then the seeds would be grown and exposed to the virus as well to ensure that the system is working.The results were conclusive in finding that the protein profile of GM rice had minimal differences to its control in comparison with the parental lines and other GM breeds .This is mainly because the Canadian food inspection agency focuses on characteristics expressed in each product rather than the methods used to introduce those characteristics.Another consideration for target site selection is the cleavage efficiency, a variable trait of the Cas9 nuclease .The process of regulating a genetically engineered product is the same as regular products that is introduces for the first time.In addition, his stance on genetic modification of foods and its research were discussed; it was insightful to see the extent to which the role in the food industry has influenced their views.This proposes safety concerns in the natural arms race of plant-virus evolution.Familiarity looks at the current knowledge of the plant species and past experiences with that species in Canada .After reading through the patent, we were interested to understand the scope of the statement: \u0093Covers any engineered CRISPR-cas9 system\u0085\u0094.This debate is not limited to general public knowledge, but extends into the data and literature as well.These methods are delving into the biochemical output of the genome, including comparison studies of proteomes, transcriptomes, and metabolomes with cell lines subjected to natural genetic variation and conventional breeding methods .In China, the population of secondary pests has increased following the wide-scale adoption of this Bt cotton .Previous research has shown that the 20nt target sequence in the sgRNA requires only 8-12nt at the 3\u0092 end for site hybridization .After the visit, our team is assessing the potential of involving ourselves in the circulation of farmer-centred reading material may be the ideal avenue for which we could eventually market our GM-plants.Many studies have documented a high off-target mutation rate, attributed to the short and relaxed recognition sites the sgRNA .When asked questions such as \u0093What factors affect your decision of which seed to buy?\u0094, the growers emphasized their interest in meeting the needs of their customers.", "modeling": "Unfortunately, no number for this infection probability could be found in literature, so a reasonable approximation of this value was implemented in order to emulate normal viral spread.Initial Infection Sites is a user-selected integer representing the number of lesions on a plant leaf for the application of the virusFounder Population represents the number of viruses in each of the lesions, or the multiplicity of infection, which should be between 2 and 13 Viral Spread Rates the virus spreads at a rate of about 3 cells per day, but it takes longer for the cell to begin actively producing and exporting virionsSAR or Systemic Acquired Response, is a form of acquired immunity.A typical model run proceeds as follows:The virus quickly spreads to most of the initially infected lead, with only a small amount of resistance developing.Once it has spread to this entire leaf, it spreads into the plant\u0092s vascular system and the main stem.Soon, all of the vascular structure is carrying the virus.In a few cases, the plant is lucky & the initial infection was small, so the infection did not spread beyond the first leaf.This signaling causes systemic required resistance, a broad, long-term increased resistant to future infections..Explain and link this to the parameters in the model once the parameters are finalized For information on this, please see the Intercellular Spread section of the CaMV biology page here.The model has been simplified to have both HR and SAR spread through the plant using one signalling chemical instead of the complex interactions between several different signalling molecules separately .We identified several requirements for the software used in our agent-based model:Three different software packages (MASON, MESA and Netlogo) were considered in depth.The level of resistance is correspondingly lower, since the plant detects less of a threat.This effective prevention of viral spread is maintained even with moderate increases in other viral parameters and/or decrease in resistance.As with many projects in mathematical biology, one of the biggest challenges is finding accurate parameter values.However, most simulation runs result in over half the plant being infected.Agent-based Netlogo model shows the spread of infection (red) and acquired resistance (blue) in a leaf where each agent simulates an ODE replication model.To trace the spread of the virus through the leaf, we used an agent-based model.The plant produces signalling molecules and enables cells to become resistant or lyse themselvesResistance Threshold is the level of SA signalling molecule required for a cell to become resistant to the pathogenLysis Threshold is the level of SA signalling molecule required for a cell to undergo apoptosis to protect the rest of the organismSignalling Molecule is generated by resistant or susceptible cells neighbouring infected or resistant cells at a rate of one per minute, after those neighbours have been infected/resistant for 8hrs.While this doesn\u0092t quite give the probability per time of attempted spread events, it\u0092s a very promising line of inquiry.A different direction in which this model could be improved is having a more detailed and faithful plant architecture.Agent-based Netlogo model shows the spread of infection (red) and acquired resistance (blue) in a leaf where each agent simulates an ODE replication model.MESA is a Python-based simulation package and was not used due to its poor documentation and the level of familiarity with Python required to create the model.In others, the infection spreads into the leaf, but a sizable fraction of it becomes resistant.Apoptosis occurs near the boundaries between infected and resistant regions, often cutting off these regions from the rest of the plant.These phloem cannot produce either viral particles or resistance molecules themselves; they only act as conduits to pass them along.Viral Spread Chance - each time step, infected cells have a small probability of passing a virion to a neighboring cell.The spread through the stems and leaves of the plant can be tracked with and without the CRISPR/Cas9 system.This leads to our second goal which is to integrate the intracellular replication and intercellular spread models to fully understand impact of CRISPR/Cas9.Without CRISPR, one leaf is entirely overwhelmed.We were quite successful in making a reasonable representation of the normal process of viral spread.Cells are only connected by plasmodesmata to other cells in the same leaf.Each leaf also has one phloem (stem) that links to the central vasculature of the plant.Viral spread has been modeled extensively on very small scales and on large (population) scales, but, surprisingly, the middle ground of intercellular spread is relatively unexplored .Altogether, we are attempting to demonstrate the feasibility of our anti-viral system and use our findings to direct the project design.As a reaction to the presence of the virus, the plant cells will destroy infected cells through apoptosis as well as signal to the rest of the plant to begin production of defensive chemicals in preparation for attack.The CRISPR effect parameter (t1/2) is captured in the ODE.When we introduce our CRISPR/Cas9 mechanism, and hold all other parameters constant, we see that the infection is stopped remarkably quickly.Infected cells run an instance of our ODE model for viral replication; they may also pass infection to their neighbors.Although fewer built-in functions could be an advantage (adding more flexibility and customization to the simulation), time constraints and unfamiliarity with Java pushed us to use NetLogo instead of MASON.But the infection runs its own course in each leaf.In some cases, resistance builds up and seals off the point of initial infection.Our slider-based approach was a creative solution that enables us to investigate the balance of different factors in viral spread and resistance, but it was quite arbitrary.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "Gently mix the culture, pipette 20\u00b5L of culture and spreak on YEP agar with appropriate antibiotics and incubate

verification of the results.The pipeline is described in more detail on the Pam Flexibility page and is visualized below.PAM Flexibility software pipeline: the 3D Cas9 structure is mutated, then 256 variants with different PAM DNA structures are created, then PyRosetta is used to score PAM affinities.In addition, we mutated dCas9 at three sites 1135, 1335, and 1337 to alter its PAM site from native NGG to NGAG using the Quick Change protocol.This page offers a general summary, while more details can be found on our wet lab overview, mathematical modelling and policy & human practices overview pages.For the Simple sgRNA Exchange, we were able to show that adding restriction sites and a single mutation in the scaffold region of the sgRNA did not reduce targeting of the sgRNA in CRISPR dCas9 system.The team created a multi-scale model that showed the effect of CRISPR/Cas9 on viral genomes, viral replication and viral spread across multiple plant cells.A stochastic model of Cas9 cleavage was able to estimate the effects of CRISPR-Cas9 on the viral genome.The viral genomes were then simulated with an exponential decay from functional to non-functional forms.CRISPR effect parameter (t1/2) is derived from an exponential fit to the fraction of CaMV genomes active at each timestep across 1000 stochastic genome simulations.The CRISPR effect parameter (t1/2) is passed on to a model of the intracellular viral replication cycle.Preliminary experiments were done using sgRNA targeting the J23101 promoter upstream of the GFP using NGAG PAM site, however the results, graphed below, were inconclusive.Non-functional virion production is lowered because fewer functional proteins that protect against RNAi are produced.Both the time series data and heat maps highlight how the CRISPR genome modification has a greater effect on the virion concentration than the plant defenses alone.However, a protoplast model was used that demonstrated successful expression of Cas9 in plant cells, as shown on the dot blot below.Two dot blots using anti-Cas9 antibody demonstrate protoplast expression.These results were then carried forward into an agent-based model on the level of plant leaves, discussed in detail on the Intracellular Spread page.The graphs of flow cytometry data can be seen below and more details on the results are available on the sgRNA Exchange page.RFP Intensity

used to come up with starting pattern for the previous model so that the interactions remain contant over time.The previous model of using DNA as a glue could create 3D shapes but would need vast amounts of unique zinc fingers.We also needed to invent a novel approach to creating 2D shapes using cells, this page discusses binding them to a longer string of DNA to form a pattern.After the inherent problems and issues found from using the first model of 2D shapes we came up with a second, which discusses the use of DNA as an oligonucleotide adhesive to create 2D and 3D structures and shapes.The previous model works but would change over time as the cells grow.This wasn t possible with our time frame so we came up with a model which could create a 3D structure from the minimum amount of unique DNA using tetrahedrons as a base to build from.Cells would then be bound to the outside.The tetrahedron construction model could only create sphere shaped 3D structures.The cells that bound to the outside couldn t be controlled as well as we hoped so we came up with a new model that could.This page discusses the use of cube shaped DNA to create a shape where the cells bonded to the outside could be chosen.Once we had an idea of how we could create small shapes using cells we wanted a quick overview how larger objects could be made.This page discusses this and shows a program designed to dictate concentrations for the biologists to use.Once we had a method of calculating the concentration of cells needed we had to model the number of cells required to make a certain

binding of fluorescent antibodies to the cell surface, we should be able to visualise the cells.We tested the extent to which each of our zinc fingers (zif 268, sZF2, sZF10 and sZF14) proteins were expressed on the surface of our cells by using immunofluorescence microscopy.To do this, a FLAG tag (predesigned to be within our construct) was fused to the surface display anchor proteins to which our zinc finger proteins are attached.The introduction of an anti-flag antibody, followed by a secondary antibody (a fluorescently labelled anti-mouse antibody) allowed our E. coli cells to be visualised.Experiment 4: Binding fluorescent zinc finger expressing cells to oligos on a glass slide Objective: To see whether we can control the precise locations of different coloured cells through binding of the zinc finger proteins to oligonucleotides in specific positions on a glass slide.A range of zinc finger expressing cells would be prepared (with the cells for each zinc finger corresponding to one particular colour).Different oligos would be placed on a glass slide in specific places (either by hand, or using a parafilm template).Experiment 5: Binding fluorescent zinc finger expressing cells to oligonucleotide adhesive Objective: To see whether we can control the binding of different cell types to an engineered DNA structure.Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we would visualise our slide, and see cells of different colours coming together to form a \u0091picture\u0092.Immobilised wild type DH5? Z1 cells (washed with oligos) should show no fluorescence, as the oligos should not be able to bind to the cells.Uninduced cells should not be expressing any zinc finger proteins on their surface, so should show no fluorescence.coli cells expressing each of our 4 zinc finger proteins were immobilised onto glass slides Bacterial Immunofluorescence Protocol.Fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides (containing the zinc finger binding domains) were added.Binding of the zinc finger proteins to the fluorescent oligonucleotides allows visualisation of the cells by immunofluorescence

folding correctly and then being transported to the cell membrane effectively.Bacterial Immunofluorescence Protocol.No / little fluorescence: Zinc finger proteins should not be expressed on the surface of the wild type and uninduced E. coli cells.This is because the oligos should bind to the cells, so are not removed during the washing stages.To test the specificity of our zinc finger proteins, each cell type was washed with oligos matching a different zinc finger.Although the zinc finger proteins will stay attached to their binding domains, cutting the oligonucleotide at this site allows cells to become \u0091unstuck\u0092 from the slides.Experiment 1: Testing the binding of specifically designed DNA strands to glass slidesObjective: To ensure that our zinc finger binding domains are able to bind to a glass slide, and can be visualised through immunofluorescent microscopy.Glass slides were prepared (Glass Slide Preperation Protocol) by being cleaned and functionalised (with HCl and GOPTS respectively).Specifically designed oligonucleotides containing zinc finger binding domains were introduced to the slides.These oligonucleotides comprise of a general adaptor strand, a specific short strand and a specific long strand.Terminal amine groups within the oligonucleotides bind (by a nucleophilic addition reaction) to the epoxy group of GOPTS, sticking the DNA to the glass slides.The presence of an EcoR1 cut site in the oligonucleotide allows us to have an extra level of control in our experiments.Experiment 3: Reciprocal experiment - binding of fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides to immobilised cells Objective: To ensure that our zinc finger proteins are able to bind to fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides which contain the zinc finger binding

proteins on the surface of E. coli cells upon induction with IPTG Our objective was to prove that the modified protein was being expressed on the surface of the plasmid transformed cells.Upon comparison of image B and C,it is clear that the modified protein is being expressed upon induction with IPTG.Image B shows that the Pl_lac promoter did not leak and cause uninduced cells to express the protein in great enough numbers to be visible.Experiment 3: Reciprocal experiment - binding of fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides to immobilised cells When testing the binding of the fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides to the zinc finger proteins, we would expect to see fluorescence only when the correct oligonucleotides were added to the induced cells for each zinc finger.However, due to the patterns in the image, we cannot assume that the fluorescence is a positive result for the expression of sZF10; it may just be background noise again.Instead, we found that all of our images showed fluorescence.There could be many reasons for this, including background noise, errors in the washing method, and fluorescence due to the use of LB.The exception to this was the experiment using sZF10.While this plasmid was sequenced successfully, the colony that these cells originate from came from a replating of the original successful colony.These induced cells are the most clearly fluorescent from the set that was measured.By comparing images A and C it is clear that the fluorescence is caused by the protein being expressed on the cell surface.However, the wild type cell shows fluorescence as well, suggesting that there is an error with our method of washing the cells after the fluorescent antibodies have been applied.Based on the previous results we decided to alter the protocol for preparing cells for microscopy, instead of fixing the cells on a glass slide, these cells were in liquid medium on the slide.A random mutation in the colony that these cells were grown from could be the cause.This image shows that while there are clearly cells present, none of the cells are fluorescing.A non-fluorescent image was taken of the induced slide to confirm this.The background noise on image C is reduced due to the microscope s automatic contrast.Two slides were used: a GOPTS-treated slide that should bind aminated DNA, and a control slide that was cleaned like the GOPTS slide, but was not treated with the GOPTS solution, and should not bind DNA (aminated or otherwise).", "safety": "", "keywords": "sofra-tulle installation ?-carotene luciferase

"Reactions were stopped using 1 mM hydrochloric acid.A fusion of an ampicillin-binding aptamer and the HRP-F8 DNAzyme was incubated with hydrogen peroxide and TMP in either the presence or absence of ampicillin in A) reaction buffer or B) ampicillin-spiked energy drink.Fusions of a ketamine-binding aptamer and the HRP-F8 fusion DNAzyme designed to switch either on or off in the presence of ketamine as well as negative controls (DNAzymes predicted by our software to not possess an efficient switching behavior) were incubated with hydrogen peroxide and TMP in either the presence or absence of ketamine.Catalytic activity of the ampicillin-responsive DNAzyme drastically increased upon exposure to its ligand (Fig.Plotting those against the concentration gives good indication on the switching behavior of a certain candidate.First we can confirm the capability of our system to provide reasonable data and for example show that the activity of the HRP-mimicking DNAzyme is independent from the concentration of the screened Kanamycin ligand.As we want to characterize the aptamers generated by the MAWS software the best way possible, we want to guess this parameter from the data we record during this screening effort with our modelling approach.To obtain this necessary data we had to record the enzyme activity of a DNAzyme candidate at multiple ligand concentration levels.Therefore the best switching behavior should be observed with stems of medium strength.To perform this screening with the necessary throughput to validate numerous aptamer and DNAzyme candidates generated by the software with the necessary precision, we resorted to a robot aided screening in 96well plates.The point at which a sufficient amount of ligand binds the DNAzymes to show activity is therefore determined by the affinity of the aptamer, described by its KD (B) For a very weak stem full activity independent from ligand concentration can be expected.Therefore we created a system in which the background of the HRP-mimicking DNAzyme is effectively suppressed by a rigid stem, which has to be cleaved by an integrated F8 DNAzyme.(A) Both the aptamer affinity and the strength of the communicating stem influence the switching behavior.A strong stem encaging nucleotides of the actual DNAzyme sequence which forms the G-quadruplex, inactivates the hemin binding and therefore the catalysis.To create these constructs, we relied on the capabilities of our JAWS software.Yet if the stem is getting stronger than the energy gained from ligand binding, the amount of switching DNAzymes decreases.If part of the stem is stabilized by nucleotides of an aptamer, the binding of the aptamer destabilizes the inhibiting stem and can activate the DNAzyme.To test this detection system in a more realistic setting, the DNAzyme was incubated in energy drink spiked with ampicillin.Binding of the ligand naturally decreases the stem stability.Aptamers for ampicillin and ketamine were joined to the stem of the fused F8 DNAzyme to regulate its cleavage activity.This equilibrium is creating a bistable system so it can be shifted by the binding of the ligand to the aptamer.So these techniques are excellent in providing high quality data in the lab, but are hard to convert into a cheap and portable system for ligand detection and measurement.The other important variable contributing to the behavior of the switching DNAzyme is the affinity of the aptamer.Yet if the stem is rather weak the amount of active G-quadruplexes, which have been formed without the binding of any ligand molecules, increases.This can easily be done by contracting nucleotides of the G-quadruplex domain into a stem.2: Switching characteristics of the aptamer dependent HRP mimicking DNAzyme.The fusion DNAzymes were tested against their respective ligand in solution, where 1 \u00b5M DNAzyme hemine solution was incubated together with the ligand, hydrogen peroxide, and TMB.For switching, stem has to be in similar range of formation energy to the strong gros2005hemin-G-quadruplex-complex to enable an equilibrium state.To record a time series on luminol luminescence for every well without a timing bias of sequential scanning, we chose to scan all wells of the plates simultaneously with a western blot documentation camera in repetitive capture mode.The recorded sequences were segmented by automated ImageJ masks to obtain the mean intensity for each well at all time points.Necessary for its function is the incorporation of hemin into a G-quadruplex structure.The determining factor for the performance of aptamers is its binding affinity described by the KD value.After addition of the 1\u00b5M DNAzyme/hemin mix a western blotting luminol substrate was dispensed to all wells at a specified time point.Yet those techniques require special preparation of the aptamer to measure it and depending on the application, new protocols have to be established.To do so we chose to record the halflives of the chemiluminescent substrate luminol.Despite being very efficient in lab setups, this system has its drawbacks in end user applications, where the simple, background free detection of certain substances is the main goal.Buffer shows no clear half values but camera noise.All recorded halfvalues for Kanamycin aptamer candidates with different stem variants plotted against kanamycin ligand concentrations ranging from 0\u00b5M to 1920\u00b5M.The Hamilton Microlab Star Liquid Handling robot provided us with the necessary dilution series of the target ligand in 96well plates.To identify this parameter for our software generated aptamers and have an easy and cheap system for aptamer verification available, we created a simple DNAzyme based approach and combined it with a mathematical modelling to estimate the values.This is described by the KD value.From the two DNAzymes designed for ketamine one switched on in the presence of ketamine, while the other switched off.This complex is catalytically active but can be inhibited by the obstruction of the G-quadruplex formation.For all software generated aptamer candidates stem candidates with switching behavior suggesting trajectosies can be identified.", "design": "These selected sequences have to be further mutated over and over again in order to generate an aptamer with a high affinity.To substitute this very time consuming and expensive SELEX we developed a new software with different featuressoftware Making Apatmers Without SELEX (MAWS), which enables us to efficiently generate new aptamers within less than a day compared.Every aptamer bears the potential to be used as module in order to generate switchable aptazymes.Soukup1999 In order to obtain the best possible fusion of an aptamer with a ribozyme or DNAzyme another SELEX with several cycles would have been needed.JAWS thus bypasses the requirement for SELEX and, in conjunction with MAWS, enables rapid design-prototype-test cycles, drastically improving the stardardization and modularization of nucleic acid-based devices!In order to bypass this second time-cosuming SELEX we developed Joining Apatmers Without SELEX (JAWS).Thus we were able to predict many aptamers by MAWS and validated them in different assay during the summer.We are able to optimize the transition element to create a bistable system where either one conformation is favored in presence of the ligand while the other one is in absence of the ligand.MAWS enables the scientific community the possibility to generate aptamers for any ligand in silico.", "human_practice": "He told us about the problems in medicating cystic fibrosis with classical pharmacological approaches.We also talked about the application of a

cystic fibrosis centre (since 2009) and became head of the department of translational pulmonology translational lung research centre (TLRC) in 2012.If 1-3% of repaired RNA a therapeutic effect can be seen and with 5-10% of repaired RNA nearly all symptoms of cystic fibrosis would be gone.We also talked about testing our ribozymes with an CF lung cell line, in which we could measure the ion flow at the Mall laboratory.She encouraged us to pursue our idea though she suggested to focus on the read out.Murat was particularly interested in the software we developed to predict aptamers.At the very beginning of the development of our project the iGEM Team talked to Gabriele N\u00fcbel and Dr. Murat S\u00fcnb\u00fcl, both members of the group of professor J\u00e4schke.Mall gave us good advice for

leading to a higher number $n_A$ of consumed than ATP molecules $n_{A,M}$ incorporated in malachite green aptamers.(A) A basic model with constant numbers of $n_A$ and synthesis parameters $k_{syn,M}$, was extended to variants with $n_A$ and $k_{syn,M}$ depending on the polymerase concentration (variant 2), $A$- and $T^*$-dependent $n_A$ with exponents $k$ and $l$ (variant 3) or only an exponent for $T^*$ (variant 4).In Figure 2C, the number $n_A$ is shown for different ratios between ATP and active template concentrations using the best fit parameters of the optimal model variant.Figure 2A visualizes the improvement in fit quality from the basic model to the optimal model variant (variant 4) in values of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) that accounts for the distance between the model and the experimental data and additionally penalizes for the number of model parameters to favor parsimonious model topologies.However, both phenomena could be explained by an optimal model variant (Figure 1B, 1A, Table 1), in which the polymerase inaccuracy increased with increasing ratios between ATP and active templates.Furthermore, assuming a fast binding of the polymerase to its template, which can be reflected in the model by a steady state of active template formation, resulted in a large AIC value increase.The production of premature abortion products that result from the detachment of the polymerase from the template before completing the transcript, however, leads to an even larger number $n_A>n_{A,M}$.In particular, we could study the inaccuracy of polymerases reflected by an excess of consumed ATP molecules over the number of ATP molecules in synthesized malachite green aptamers.We have learned that the inaccuracy of an RNA polymerase increases with an increasing ratio between ATP and active templates in a non-linear manner.Next, we tried if the optimal model, variant 4, could be simplified without losing fit quality.The model thus predicts a high sensitivity of $n_A$ for changes of the $A /T^{*}$ ratio at values below $A /T^{*}approx10$ and a low sensitivity of $n_A$ at higher ratios in the range above $A /T^{*}approx30$ to $50$.After adding an RNA polymerase to DNA templates, the polymerase binds to the template and starts consuming ATP by incorporating it into transcripts containing the malachite green aptamer.Because malachite green aptamers contain $n_{A,M}=10$ adenine nucleotides, the rate, at which malachite green is produced, is at least by this factor lower than the rate, at which ATP is consumed.Leaving out ATP degradation, however, resulted only in a slight decrease in fit quality indicated by a small increase in the corresponding AIC value.This indicated that the optimal model could not be further reduced without losing fit quality.(C) Model variant 4 can explain increasing inefficiency (higher $n_A$) with decreasing $A/T^*$ ratios.Taken together, our setup was suitable for studying the phenomenon of polymerase inaccuracy based on a mathematical model.Then, we extended the model step-wise until the experimental data could be explained by the model.Stepwise changes from the basic model variant 1 to the optimal variant 4 and from variant 4 to variants 4a to 4cWhile the concentration of ATP could be monitored by fluorescence of the Spinach2-ATP-Aptamer, the transcript yield was monitored by malachite green fluorescence.IVT inaccuracy depends on the ATP to active template ratio.First, as depicted in Figure 1A, we tried to explain this inaccuracy by a constant number $n_A$ that was independent from DNA-template, ATP or polymerase concentrations.Leaving out degradation reactions for the polymerase $P$ strongly decreased fit quality (Figure 2B).", "notebook": "Plate out

cover into the corresponding well of the part that you want.", "protocol": "", "result": "We developed this system further to minimize the background activity by combining the HRP DNAzyme with an F8 ribozyme.Wang2014 This way the stem that avoids the formation of the G-quadruplex can be designed stronger, as the F8 DNAzyme is able to cleave of a part of this stem.We could show that the HRP-mimicking DNAzyme can be blotted in a Southern blot and its activity is recovered on the membrane.This results into a weakening of the stem that inhibits HRP-mimicking DNAzyme activity and thus to the formation of the G-quadruplex.This system can be used to avoid working with radioactive isotopes and also poses an alternative to using fluorescent probes.HRP-mimicking DNAzyme activity is controlled by an aptamer that stems with part of the active site in absence of the ligand.Upon binding of the hemin to the G-quadruplex the DNAzyme catalyzes the reduction of H2O2 to H2O and a reactive oxygen species and thus result to the activation of a classical HRP substrate like luminol.Upon binding of the hemin to the G-quadruplex the DNAzyme catalyzes the reduction of H2O2 to H2O and a reactive oxygen species and thus result to the activation of a classical HRP substrate like luminol.Thus the activity of the HRP DNAzyme became dependent on the presence of the ligand that can bind to the aptamer.A part of the stem is cleaved of by a switchable F8 DNAzyme in presence of a specific ligand.In presence of the ligand the inhibiting stem is destabled and thus the HRP-mimicking DNAzyme s activity is recovered.The activity of the HRP-mimicking DNAzyme is controlled via a strong stem.Aptamers generated by our software MAWS can be fused to the versatile HRP DNAzyme to produce a library of AptaBodies.The transformation of a terminal label into an internal label, one can be achieved by splinted ligation using a DNA template that is complementary to the two RNA templates that are to be connected to each other Kershaw2012.The F8 DNAzyme was fused with aptamers so that in the presence of the ligand the F8 DNAzyme becomes active which then activates the HRP-mimicking DNAzyme (Fig.Thus the HRP-mimicking DNAzyme can be used as an easy and fast readout on a Southern blot.The aptamers that were predicted by MAWS were fused with the HRP DNAzyme using JAWS to generate a bi-stable system (Fig.5).An aptamer connected via a linker to a HRP-mimicking DNAzyme that detects protein an a Western blot.Similarly to the HRP DNAzyme other DNAzymes like the RNA-cleaving DNAzymes 7-18 and 10- 23 DNAzyme can be modified to become ligand dependent.Wanga2002 Many more candidates like the ones described by Wang et al.Initially we have connected the HRP-mimicking DNAzyme via a linker region to a His-tag aptamerBartnicki2014 (Fig.3).HRP-mimicking DNAzyme folds into a G-quadruplex and binds hemin into it (Fig.Any mutation alters the effector sequence directly and thus can have severe effects on the functionality.Furthermore we have standardized the work with functional DNA.We want to provide standard parts that everyone can use to make the work with functional DNA and also RNA accessible for the whole community.HRP-mimicking DNAzyme folds into a G-quadruplex and binds hemin into it.Not only can the HRP be used in the AptaBody but the part can be adapted in other systems as well.We designed it this way because if you work with a functional RNA the sequence is extremely essential.If the functional RNA contains a cut sites usually one cannot simply mutate it as it is possible for proteins.Upon binding of the ligand the communication module transduces a change to the catalytic site and results in activity.", "safety": "In case this was to be conducted in order to follow up the ideas presented in this project, very thorough safety tests need to be performed.Besides working in the wetlab, we are proud to have worked on two pieces of software that we want to make accessible to the iGEM-community and scientists in general: MAWS and JAWS.Both softwares generate nucleic acid sequences as output, which do not impose any biological hazard.For the wetlab validation of functional nucleic acids developed by users of our software, we recommend similar safety precautions as we described earlier.As we envision the use of our Twin-Ribozymes in the role of mRNA editing in the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis, we know that further safety testing is required in order to exclude adverse effects and longterm damage to the cells.Besides, the plasmids we are using for transformation (p413, p415 for S. cerevisiae, pSB1C3 for E. coli) are not harmful for humans.As besides working with genetically modified organisms, we were focussing on functional RNA and DNA, we made sure that no harm can arise from them.Naturally, we cannot control the proper use of the designed constructs, but as they cannot replicate nor be in any form infective, biohazard is minimal.Finally, the samples one works with can be sensitive and easily degraded, hence by safety measures, researchers also secure their projects.Concerning software, the same levels of safety exist: The data entered by researchers need to be protected, misuse of the software of any kind should be prevented and the software itself needs to be secured.As were both, working with genetically modified organisms and designing a software, all of the above measures need to be thoroughly considered.We are well aware that we cannot control against which ligands the users of our software will create aptamers or aptamer-regulated functional RNA or DNA (also see software safety).Other dangerous chemicals, such as beta-mercaptoethanol, TEMED, organic solvents and acrylamide were of course handled under the fume hood.Besides the different working sections, we also separated programming and documentation from bench work, as we decided never to handle any electronics wearing gloves.Secondly and even more importantly, all experiments involving those substances were only conducted under the supervision of a physician.Apart from the mere use and proof of concept, our most fundamental goal is to provide the community of synthetic biology with standardized, yet versatile tools to design, create, express and ultimately validate novel functional RNA and DNA.Also, we read about the official safety guidelines proposed by the iGEM HQ online.We were highly sensible regarding possible spillages of E. coli as that might ruin our RNA based experiments, because of which we chose not to use certain parts of equipment for cells in order to keep them clean and our samples safe.As we worked with genetically modified organisms, a special focus should be set on wetlab safety.The organisms we were using, i.e.There we had enough space for several computers and laptops, so that the programming could be safely separated from the lab work.As a precaution against spread of modified organisms, equipment and benches were regularly cleaned using EtOH.During this act of cleaning we wore special mouthgards so that we would not breathe in any of the potentially harmful chemicals.We not only separated a RNAse free part of the lab, but also designated a special area for running gels, as we would be handling chemicals like EtBr and SYBR Safe for staining.Watch the two videos below for further good instructions on lab safety!Before starting with the wetlab work, Dr. Barbara DiVentura gave us a safety instruction in which she informed us about how to work in the lab and what was considered as good practice.The first step towards good lab safety are personal precautions such as wearing lab coast, gloves in regards to the handled matter and safety goggles.In this context, safety has to be understood on multiple levels.Firstly, the researcher needs to secure himself from any danger conveyed by what he is working with.As we have been working RNA which is highly sensible to contaminations, we cleaned a part of our lab using hydrogenperoxide.Chemical hazard on the other hand is also not very high as there are no known pathogenic functions of the small nucleic acids that can be generated with our software.MAWS and JAWS are both not relying on a web-interface.As the designer of the constructs will not need to work with the organisms that produce the particular aptamers, biosafety concerns are very low.Secondly, on a larger scale, society needs to be kept safe from anything that could escape the lab or be released and thereby impose a threat - that is the immanent responsibility of the scientist.S. cerevisiae, E. coli strain DH5?, E. coli Top 10, as well as all cell lines, namely HEK 293T and HeLa cells are suitable for the S1-safety laboratory we are working in.", "keywords": "anaphylaxis7 consequences9 bio-painting creativity concentrations SynBioCraft organophosphorus production pesticides Erythromycin", "track": "Foundational Advance",

variable insert, because in the used scaffold, we have only randomized the third Complementarity-determining region (CDR3), which is known to be the main binding CDR (Krebber et al., 1997).By using specific mixtures of bases for defined positions in the oligonucleotide synthesis resulting in degenerate codons coding for a defined mix of amino acids in the variable regions of our scaffolds we achieve a theoretical diversity of 1,073,741,824 proteins sequences for each library.Amplifying BBa_K2082001 with primers NB-bb-fw and NB-bb-rev results in a backbone, which was used to insert the annealed and replenished variable fragment F2 = F2-1 (a) + F2-2 (b) by Gibson assembly.The core of our system is the combination of the library with a mutation system and a selection system, to optimize binding proteins to Evobodies.Scientific studies also have shown the importance of tyrosine in the CDS of synthetic binding proteins (Fellouse et al., 2004).One major advantage of a library is the availability of a wide range of different binding proteins as starting material for the evolution process, which ensures that candidates with limited but evolvable affinity are present from the outset.Small letters denote the oligonucleotides which were used for library assembly.To create our Monobody library, we constructed the fundamental framework (BBa_K2082004) composed of the Monobody constant regions with an inserted RFP as a place holder for the variable regions, which can easily be exchanged.Table 1 shows the used randomized IUPAC nucleotide naming and the encoded bases: Table 2: used randomized codons and resulting amino acids:Phenylalanine, Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine, Tyrosine, Histidine, Asparagine, Aspartic AcidFinally, we achieved a theoretic variability of 1,073,741,824 different molecules for Monobodies and Nanobodies, respectively.Therefore, we decided to do the gene synthesis of the library ourselves and ordered a small number of larger, partly randomized oligonucleotides (from Metabion).An Evobody is a binding protein resulting from the combination of a scaffold, be it Monobody or Nanobody, with a continuously mutation and selection system, and thus represents the fusion of a semi rational design approach with evolution.A library is a collection of identical plasmids that only vary in the protein coding sequences (CDS).The size of tyrosine also leads to many van der Waals\u00b4 contacts and the -OH group provides electrostatic interactions for binding (Mian et al., 1991).First of all, in our library design, we avoided stop codons to guarantee the synthesis of the complete binding proteins.In the first steps, the constant regions of our binding protein scaffolds (Monobody and Nanobody) were ordered as gene as synthesized IDT G-Blocks\u00ae and inserted in the vector via Gibson assembly.Furthermore, we preferred amino acids that are beneficial to a high binding affinity.DOI: 10.1016/j.jmb.2007.08.005.Koide, Shohei; Sidhu, Sachdev S. (2009): The importance of being tyrosine: lessons in molecular recognition from minimalist synthetic binding proteins.To get in this directed evolution process, some binding proteins must show at least a marginal affinity to the chosen target protein.This fact leads to another benefit of tyrosine in binding proteins by providing a high specificity (Koide et al., 2010).The amphipathic nature of the tyrosine is also helpful in the different hydrophobic and hydrophilic environments in antibody-antigen complexes (Mian et al., 1991).To make sure, that the designed binding proteins work and that the initial libraries contained some useful Monobodies and Nanobodies, respectively, we performed a phagemid display, using phagemid pAK100 and M13 derived helper phages.Bogan, A.Small letters denote the oligonucleotides which were used for library assembly.Similar to Monobodies, we built up a universal framework for Nanobodies, containing rpoZ, c-Myc-linker and a constant Nanobody segment (BBa_K2082001).For constructing the coding sequence, we utilized the IUPAC ambiguity base naming scheme for the ordering of our oligonucleotides at a vendor, which did support the equimolar mixing of nucleotides.Likewise, the binding hot spots for protein-protein interactions are often enriched in tyrosine, tryptophan and arginine (Bogan and Thorn, 1998).To insert the variable regions, we amplified the backbone, including Monobody constant regions, the cMyc-linker and rpoZ by using the primers MB-bb-fw and MB-bb-rev.Fellouse, Frederic A.; Wiesmann, Christian; Sidhu, Sachdev S. (2004): Synthetic antibodies from a four-amino-acid code: a dominant role for tyrosine in antigen recognition.Since the practical diversity of our library is limited by the transformation efficiency of E. coli, the theoretical library size needed to be chosen carefully to maximize the binding the potential while avoiding dilution in unproductive (i.e.The tyrosine side chain bears most of the contacts necessary for high affinity antigen recognition in synthetic libraries of binding proteins.To achieve a complete Monobody from our submitted part, the RFP can be replaced with randomized variable regions allowing an easy visual control.Furthermore, due to our evolution system, only a weak affinity is required in the first place which can then mature to high affinity.As starting point of our directed evolution system for binding proteins we needed a numerousness of partly randomized Monobodies and Nanobodies, respectively, to emerge our Evobodies.Finally, the respective binding protein got fused with RpoZ, the omega domain of RNA polymerase, via a c-Myc-linker to enable selection for good target affinity.In: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 101 (34), S. 12467\u009612472.After annealing the single stranded oligonucleotides V1-1 (a) + V1-2 (b) filling in the parts resulting in the double stranded fragment V1 and annealing

smaller amino acids provide the necessary space and protein conformation flexibility (Koide et al., 2010).We decided to optimize the library by using restricted yet proven codon or amino acids set, respectively, for the complementary determining regions (CDRs).After transformation into E. coli a heterogeneous culture is created and after plating the transformation each colony carries a different insert encoding a different binding protein (Osoegawa et al., 2001).In: Journal of Molecular Biology 334 (4), S. 733\u0096749.In: Journal of Molecular Biology 373 (4), S. 924\u0096940.After generating the double stranded library fragments, these were cloned in the library vector using a Gibson assembly, due to the incorporated overlap with the vector.As a realistic library size, we obtained for a diversity of about one billion varieties.Most of the gene synthesis companies do not offer long gene fragments with partly randomized sequences and if they do the synthesis of a whole library is prohibitively expensive (about 5-10 k\u0080) and time consuming.Another ~30 % is assembled of small amino acids like serine, glycine, alanine and threonine (Mian et al., 1991; Zemlin et al., 2003).",

expression of the reporter gene is lower (bad affinity) than in the case of a more stable complex (moderate or optimal affinity).In comparison to the beta-lactamase curves, figure 1 (B) shows the active ampicillin concentrations for the different affinities in the periplasm.The final active ampicillin concentration is then converted into a reproduction rate for the particular E. coli cell (figure 1 (C)).The computed reproduction rates, 1.0532?h-1 for optimal, 0.7248?h-1 for moderate and 0.1569?h-1 for bad affinity from model I are transferred to model?II, the competition model.If the proportion of ampicillin does not lead to death a high ampicillin concentration will cause growth inhibitions.To ensure that our program can deal with all extreme cases, we made a simulation run of three different affinities: an optimal affinity, a moderate affinity and a bad affinity.The time scale for the events in the cell is limited to 20 minutes, because after 20 minutes it is assumed that the cell divides:Figure 1: (A) Beta-lactamase concentration in periplasm for optimal, moderate and bad affinity.All ampicillin curves have a very strong decline, due to the fact that beta-lactamase is highly active.As a result our program computes a final concentration of active ampicillin of 1.2682?*?10-6?M for optimal affinity, 2.3616?*?10-6?M for moderate affinity and 5.9811?*?10-6?M for bad affinity.Furthermore, the beta-lactamase curve resembling moderate affinity has an observable higher end concentration than the strain equipped with the bad affinity.These results are as assumed, because the change in affinity for the two components of the B2H complex causes a particular expression of the reporter gene, here beta-lactamase.We built a conglomeration of two models in order to find the best cultivation time and inoculation number.This approach made it possible to predict when the desired proportion of the best adapted E. coli culture is reached.The model for the bacterial two hybrid system, model?I, needs the affinity value of the bacterial two hybrid complex as an input.For the first 200 seconds, the ampicillin concentration for all affinities extremely rises, because the beta-lactamase concentration is too low at this time and thus the probability for an encounter of beta-lactamase and ampicillin is low.(C) Growth curves for optimal, moderate and bad affinity.In figure 1 (A) the beta-lactamase concentrations in the periplasm for the 3 affinities are shown.After 20 minutes the strain with the optimal affinity comprises a significantly higher beta-lactamase concentration than the other two strains.In the first 200 seconds the beta-lactamase concentration does not rise very strongly, because the products for the bacterial two hybrid complex (B2H) must firstly be produced.If the beta-lactamase concentration in the cell is too low and the ampicillin concentration is too high, the cell dies.After around 200 seconds the beta-lactamase starts to significantly deactivate ampicillin and the active ampicillin concentration falls.The growth behavior under several inoculations is depicted in the following movie:As a result model?II creates a 3D plot that shows how long the cultivation must last and how often an inoculation must be done till the desired proportion of the best adapted E. coli culture is reached.It then simulates the events in the cell which are essential for the bacterial two hybrid system and the resulting production of beta-lactamase.(B) Beta-lactamase concentration in periplasm for an optimal, a moderate and a bad

bacterial two hybrid complex dissociates quickly, the expression of the reporter gene is lower (bad affinity) than in the case of a more stable complex (moderate or optimal affinity).In comparison to the beta-lactamase curves, figure 1 (B) shows the active ampicillin concentrations for the different affinities in the periplasm.The final active ampicillin concentration is then converted into a reproduction rate for the particular E. coli cell (figure 1 (C)).The computed reproduction rates, 1.0532?h-1 for optimal, 0.7248?h-1 for moderate and 0.1569?h-1 for bad affinity from model I are transferred to model?II, the competition model.If the proportion of ampicillin does not lead to death a high ampicillin concentration will cause growth inhibitions.To ensure that our program can deal with all extreme cases, we made a simulation run of three different affinities: an optimal affinity, a moderate affinity and a bad affinity.The time scale for the events in the cell is limited to 20 minutes, because after 20 minutes it is assumed that the cell divides:Figure 1: (A) Beta-lactamase concentration in periplasm for optimal, moderate and bad affinity.All ampicillin curves have a very strong decline, due to the fact that beta-lactamase is highly active.As a result our program computes a final concentration of active ampicillin of 1.2682?*?10-6?M for optimal affinity, 2.3616?*?10-6?M for moderate affinity and 5.9811?*?10-6?M for bad affinity.Furthermore, the beta-lactamase curve resembling moderate affinity has an observable higher end concentration than the strain equipped with the bad affinity.These results are as assumed, because the change in affinity for the two components of the B2H complex causes a particular expression of the reporter gene, here beta-lactamase.We built a conglomeration of two models in order to find the best cultivation time and inoculation number.This approach made it possible to predict when the desired proportion of the best adapted E. coli culture is reached.The model for the bacterial two hybrid system, model?I, needs the affinity value of the bacterial two hybrid complex as an input.For the first 200 seconds, the ampicillin concentration for all affinities extremely rises, because the beta-lactamase concentration is too low at this time and thus the probability for an encounter of beta-lactamase and ampicillin is low.(C) Growth curves for optimal, moderate and bad affinity.In figure 1 (A) the beta-lactamase concentrations in the periplasm for the 3 affinities are shown.After 20 minutes the strain with the optimal affinity comprises a significantly higher beta-lactamase concentration than the other two strains.In the first 200 seconds the beta-lactamase concentration does not rise very strongly, because the products for the bacterial two hybrid complex (B2H) must firstly be produced.If the beta-lactamase concentration in the cell is too low and the ampicillin concentration is too high, the cell dies.After around 200 seconds the beta-lactamase starts to significantly deactivate ampicillin and the active ampicillin concentration falls.The growth behavior under several inoculations is depicted in the following movie:As a result model?II creates a 3D plot that shows how long the cultivation must last and how often an inoculation must be done till the desired proportion of the best adapted E. coli culture is reached.It then simulates the events in the cell which are essential for the bacterial two hybrid system and the resulting production of beta-lactamase.(B) Beta-lactamase concentration

"description": "Our project focuses on expanding the repertoire of chemoreceptors found in nature.The base of our project is the E. coli Tar chemoreceptor or more specifically, its ligand binding domain (LBD).Histamine-Tar, a receptor constructed with the help of computational design - using the  Rosetta  bioinformatics software suite to design mutations in the Tar receptor.Using S.Tar, scientists will be able to control the movement of bacteria, and direct them towards or away from a target material.fluidic chip, which utilizes the high sensitivity of the chemotactic response.These are transmembrane proteins, that contain a periplasmic ligand binding domain (sensing region) and a conservative cytoplasmic domain (signaling region).A detailed explanation on the chemotaxis system can be found The variety of chemoreceptors existing in nature is limited, and most of them comprise of relatively the same structure.We show that by mutating the native Tar LBD (2) or by interchanging it with that of other receptors (3), the E. coli chemotaxis system can be programmed to respond to completely new ligands.Fig.PctA-Tar , a chimera created by replacing the Tar LBD with that of the

novel detection tool based on the chemotaxis system of E. coli bacteria.E. coli with a S.Tar PctA receptor exposed to motility buffer (control).After 15[min] , a noticeable color gradient is formed in the channel.If the sample contains a repellent, the bacteria The chemotactic response will result in visible changes in the bacterial concentration throughout the chip: Very low concentration in the immediate area of the slot in which the sample was loaded, adjacent to a higher concentration of bacteria created due to the fleeing bacterial population.If the sample contains the substance that is recognized by the chemoreceptor, a displacement of the bacteria will become visible.1: A scheme of the FlashLab concept, add bacteria expressing the chemoreceptor of your choice and a chromo protein,

equipment and expertise.Expensive- Cost effective: The only major cost is the fluidic chip which costs about 15$ and can be reused multiple times.If not, then no displacement will be seen.The device is composed of a commercial fluidic chip:The chip is open on the bottom part and closed with a standard microscope cover glass (0.3 [mm] thick).The setup of the device is composed of two parts, as shown below (Figure 2):\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a.These changes will be visible to the naked eye, as the higher concentration of colored bacteria results in darker color (blue gradient, figures 2 and 3).If the sample does not contain the target material, the bacteria will not react and no gradient will be formed.The following table summarizes the most common methods in the field:Fusion of a reporter gene to a biological biobrick which is regulated by a material of interest.All other bacteria in the channel, were not exposed to the repellent and did not react accordingly.We developed FlashLab, the hardware of the S.Tar platform.Adjacent to it, an area with a darker tone and from there up to the end of the channel, the color did not change at all.The setup of the device is as shown in the \"Design\" Tab.This is faster than most other bacterial based detection that depends on transcription and translation.- Versatile: The S.Tar system enables this device to detect a variety of materials: hormones, amino acids, organic compounds etc.- User friendly: The setup of the system is an easy two part process.FlashLab, offers a fast, cheap, easy to use and versatile detection.1.The unique composition of our team was crucial to the construction of a complex but elegant system.There are several methods for detection of small molecules.FlashLab is an application of the S.Tar project.S.Tar has the potential to offer a wide library of \u0093expert\u0094 strains for the detection of materials that do not naturally induce chemotactic movement in the native E. coli.The darker shade is the clustering of bacteria in the chemo-repellent diffusion limit.Naylor, Louise H. \"Reporter gene technology: the future looks bright.Add the sample in question to the chip.This fits the theory perfectly, as the lighter shade is caused by colored bacteria moving away from the repellent.Our team is comprised of students from the faculty of Biotechnology that oversaw the Tar chemoreceptor modification in the wet lab, students from the faculties of Mechanical engineering and Chemical engineering that developed the mathematical model for the flow and chemotaxis profiles inside the microchannel and students from the faculties of Electrical engineering and Computer Science that were in charge of the computational design aspects of the project.A

Our code can be found here.-Because of the geometric properties of the channel, this is approximately a one dimensional problem.-We ran our tests in a short time scale (t<30[min]) so we presume that the change in concentration of bacteria due to life and death is negligible, k3=0.-The chemo-repellent concentration is known for every x and t.-There are no changes in the flux of bacterial concentration at the start (a) and at end of the channel (b).Under these assumptions the equation takes the form:The above partial differential equation cannot be solved analytically, so we must turn to numerical analysis tools.As the time passes the diffusion limit s speed lowers significantly, and the concentration profile becomes more linear.Most diffusion experiments need a dedicated system that is based on the diffusion of an isotope or a fluorescent material that can be detected easily and very precisely.Taking those into account, further fitting will be necessary.The basic assumptions of the model for the chemo-repellent are:- Chemo-repellent concentration in the sample is relatively low and does not cause osmotic pressure.- No other significant external forces (for example, moving the chip while using).- The bacteria do not consume the chemo-repellent and its concentration does not change with time.The \"wave\" - The bacteria react significantly less to a normalized repellent concentration of less than ~3[mm].Its mistake is \u00b1 0.5 [mm].Graph 3: Comparison of diffusion model (c=0.00015[M]) to experiment.The basic mathematical model for bacterial chemotaxis is the Keller-Segal equations (1) of chemotaxis:k2[m2/M * s] is the bacteria chemotactic coefficient.Potassium permanganate is a salt with a known diffusion limit and acts as most of the materials we want to detect using our system (small molecules).In otherwords, more bacteria move away from the concentration peak than into it for t>15[mim].- Projecting this on the chip color experiment, we can predict there will be three shades of color: weak where the bacteria moved from (low concentration), strong where the bacteria moved to (high concentration) and on the far end, unchanged as the bacteria were not exposed The experiment ran as the setup shown in the \"Overview\" section: The channel was filled with bacteria in motility buffer and then the sample was inserted.This method is guaranteed to be stable and gives us the solution for the entire space in a single point in time.Equation 3: Bacteria concentration problem \u0096 discrete form.Equation 4: Bacteria concentration problem \u0096 Final formEquation 5: Bacteria concentration problem- initial condition.And the boundary conditions which are translated to the following discrete conditions:Equation 6: Bacteria concentration problem- boundary conditionsWith I being the final value of i \u0096 index of location.The above conditions keep the flux of bacteria zero on both sides of the chip as occurs in the actual chip.The above equation was entered into the Thomas-Three-Diagonal algorithm for solving matrix equations, giving us the solution for the entire space of the problem in a specific point in time.In our experiments we were able to show that the concentration of the repellent acts as we expected in terms of changes in the diffusion limit s velocity.This will probably be corrected by using more accurate diffusion and chemotactic coefficients.Some of the inconsistencies between the model and the experiment (like the uneven cluster This model predicts the overall behavior of our system.The difference in distance between the models and the experiment can be explained by:-The actual diffusion limit is in too low concentration of potassium permanganate to be seen in the naked eye.This is due to the change in repellent concentration.The parameters used:*This is the diffusion coefficient for potassium permanganate (see \"Comparison to Experiment\")The change in distance of the diffusion limit between 0 to 15 minutes, is relatively big.2: Diffusion of potassium permanganate in water in different times (enhanced picture).As expected by the mathematical model, the diffusion limit starts moving relatively fast and its speed decreases rapidly.By advancing in time as we solve the equation at each time point we get the solution for the bacterial concentration We ran the chemo-repellent concentration equation in Matlab - Please notice, the results are normalized to enable us to show them on the same scale.First, develop models for the different coefficients in the Keller-Segal equation: bacteria diffusion coefficient, chemotactic coefficient and bacteria life and death.If the visible concentration is about 1.5*10-5 [M] the experimental results line up with the model (graph 3).When compared to the bacterial concentration, again, the experiments showed a similar behavior as the numeric solution of Keller-Segal equation.As explained before, this model requires further fitting to get more accurate results.The goal of this model is to describe the processes inside the Flash Lab system:This model is based on the Keller \u0096 Segal equation of chemotaxis (1) in It is important to notice that this model can show the overall behavior and not exact values.This continues as the bacteria s diffusion speed surpasses the chemotaxis rate.-k2 describes how sensitive is the bacteria to changes in chemo-repellent concentration.Also, by changing the geometry of the channel, the bacteria concentration will increase and cause a more noticeable signal.we chose a more basic system since this is only a preliminary testing for showing that the overall system behaves as we expect.In the future, this system can be expanded to control the efficiency of these receptors and even control other aspects of The third and final part is to improve the device itself.A detailed explanation As for the second part, the S.Tar system enables us to change the receptors a bacterium has and by that, change the materials it repels from.In contrast, in case of a chemo-attractant this assumption is not valid.- Expect to detect small proteins and molecules (the ligands).We ran the experiment 4 times, with a standard ruler to measure the distance of the diffusion limit.- The peak of bacterial concentration is caused by the bacterial chemotactic response, moving away from the chemo-repellent, and concentrating.- The \"wave\" of bacterial concentration starts moving relatively fast, and slows down quickly.Theoretically, those coefficients can be controlled by changing some parameters like or receptors a cell has, or even manipulating the biological tracks of the bacteria.The experiment ran as the setup shown in the \"Overview\" section: The channel was filled with bacteria in motility buffer and then the sample was inserted.Furthermore, the distance the bacteria passed is only a few millimeter The time scale does not line up: The color darkens as the experiment continues.This will improve the accuracy of the experiments we run, and in turn, our overall model.Also, we designed a new assay for experimentally measuring it.This assay, named Trap & Track, is a novel way to detect chemotaxis on the nanometric level.We designed a new fluidic chip This new design will give us a more controlled diffusion by cancelling out most of the flow and fixing the diffusion source.Biophysical journal, 2003, 85.6: 3558-3574..", "notebook": "His variant 9 and 6 were as expected.After PCR1, 5+6 are duplicates so we can use 6 as a template for 5 seem go s to 8+9 so we can use 9 as a template for 8.Microscope testing for: UU1250 with Tar1 & UU1250 with Tar2.Transformation to Top 10 by heat shock to all 11 variants.Microscope testing for: UU1250 with NarX, UU1250, UU1250 with PctA & UU1250 with Tar-Estr.Meeting with Einat Tamar -

UU1250 strain expressing Histamine-Tar-GFP Chimera, Finally, in the following video, a working concept of the FlashLab project - a chip that serves as a detection tool based on the chemotaxis system of E. coli bacteria.Aside from this, any receptor designed can be further improved by introducing a directed evolution step to In addition, we wrote a \u0093How to use\u0094 Rosetta guide in cooperation with the Rosetta developers andiGEM TU Eindhoven team, and built a framework software tool to allow fellow researchers the ability to redesign a binding site easily.We successfully demonstrated a working concept of the FlashLab project - a chip (commercial ibidi chip) that serves as a detection tool based on the chemotaxis system of E. coli bacteria.Negative control- UU1250 strain w/o the Tar expression plasmid, c. positive control - ?Zras strain expressing all chemoreceptors.In addition, the correct localization of the chimera on both poles of the bacterial membrane, was demonstrated by fusing GFP to the C- terminus of the chimera with a short linker sequence (K1992010).In the video, a commercial ibidi microfluidic chip filled with a suspension of bacteria expressing the chemoreceptor and chromoprotein was added to the chip and bacteria displacement was monitored and recorded(2) Histamine-Tar with Motility buffer added (control).As we demonstrated, Rosetta provides us with the means to redesign a chemoreceptor to bind new ligands.In video 2, the displacement of the bacteria can be clearly seen in the test chip (left chip, PctA-Tar with repellent), compared to the control chip (right chip, PctA-Tar with buffer).This chip is filled with a suspension of bacteria expressing a chromoprotein, enabling easy visualization of the bacteria, and a chemoreceptor engineered to respond to a specific ligand of your choice.Furthermore, the sequencing results proved that the only mutations that were present in this variant were those planned by the Rosetta\u0092s design.We observed the bacteria\u0092s response to the attractant, Histamine, by using a microscope assay.The Rosetta\u0092s design process for the new ligand, Histamine, produced 870 results, out of which 11 variants remained after filtering.it is clear that the chimera functions and controls the chemotactic ability of the bacteria and mediates to a swarming response.(2) PctA-Tar chimera with Motility buffer added (control).In conclusion, we proved the concept of the FlashLab project, by demonstrating the color gradient being formed due to chemotaxis.We have successfully confirmed the functionality of the hybrid PctA-Tar receptor using a swarming assay.Rosetta and the Design of Ligand Binding Sites.The common method to monitor the interaction of said analytes within the porous films is reflective interferometric Fourier transform spectroscopy (RIFTS), as it allows a real time measurement and output for the user.We present the results of an early experiment for the detection of chemotactic activity on the porous silicon films initially developed for bacterial detection.This assay provides us with the means to digitally quantify chemotaxis - meaning we have a clear distinction between an attractant response (negative trend), repellent response (positive trend) and no response (zero trend).The following graph presents only the chemotactic responses taken from 4 different experiments, The top 2 plots, in blue and in grey, represent a repellent response.Once a sample containing the ligand is inserted into the chip, the bacteria will respond accordingly leading a chemotactic movement towards or away from the sample.From the results seen below, figure 5, and compared to the negative control.The 11 variants were cloned into the native Tar ligand binding domain (LBD), out of these only 6 exhibited the expected sequences in sequencing and thus were subjected to chemotaxis tests.This concept has been successfully proven for both PctA-Tar chimera and Histamine-Tar variant of the Rosetta software.5: Swarming assay for attractant response of the PctA-Tar chimera.This movement causes the bacteria to form a visible cluster within the chip, due to the chromoprotein, which is seen as a darker shade of color.d. Tar-Histamine: 20 minutes after To prove the correct localization of the Tar-Histamine, GFP was fused to its C-terminus with a short linker sequence (E0040).Out of all 6 tested variants only one showed chemotactic response, the ability to be attracted to Histamine.The design was done with the Rosetta bioinformatics tool, by following the protocol published by Moretti, R. et al.The critical step of the design process remains the lab work required to clone andtest the variants, this step can be optimized by using a high throughput chemotaxis assay.This is compared to the control where no swarming can be seen.Fig.In the future this ability can be used in the same manner to design dozens of new receptors.", "safety": "Therefore, we always worked with liquid nitrogen, while wearing protective clothing, including safety goggles, cryogenic gloves and tongs.FlashLab - the product which we designed, is a fluidic chip at its core.In addition, we obeyed the Technion s official regulations To minimize risks and conduct safe research, certain rules were adapted in the lab: - Use of personal protection equipment, such as lab coats, safety goggles and rubber gloves if necessary.- Consumption of food or drinks in the lab area is prohibited.- Mandatory autoclaving of all waste that came into contact with biological materials.- Ethydium bromide - A known carcinogen, used in agarose gel.Addition of EtBr to the mix was done in a hood, and special emphasis was placed on wearing gloves and lab coats when handling gel.- Liquid nitrogen - Can cause frostbites or cryogenic burns if not handled properly.Lab safety includes everything from instructions regarding equipment, through proper protective gear, such as gloves, glasses, lab coats etc., to adequate preparations and proper disposal of chemicals and organisms.Aside from personal lab safety, we gave considerable thought to the subject of product safety as we were designing a hardware product meant for use outside of the lab.All members of the team have completed safety training, provided by our instructors.We looked into several ways to solve this problem:1) Design approach: produce the chip as a complete standalone sealed kit, meaning that in the final product, the bacteria will be placed in a vial connected to the chip.Due to this limitation, the genetically engineered bacteria can be spilt from the chip if the user does not handle it properly.To increase product safety even further we looked into a second solution.2) Biological approach: Using a kill switch system to prevent environmental risks, in case of release.When the IPTG concentration in the medium is low, the kill switch will be activated.While working in the lab, safety was always our top concern.This kill switch depends on the concentration of IPTG in the environment.In addition, we received information about the location of fire alarms, safety showers, extinguishers and fume hoods.During the project, we worked with the following strains of E. coli: UU1250, Top10, B275?

briefly explained, we proceeded with the questions which were devided into 4 parts: general questions about genetic engineering, specific questions concerning the different kinds of genetic engineering, the introduction of our project in particular and asking the interviewees about their opinion on it.Within our interviews, we hoped that by presenting our project to the politicians we could manage to better their attitude towards synthetic biology into a more positive and open feeling.In addition to that, they do also have a good impression of the general opinion of their voters concerning certain topics.The core idea was to depict the politician\u0092s opinions concerning synthetic biology.In the conclusion part we extended our questions to find out about the politician\u0092s voters\u0092 opinion and asked whether projects like ours could have a positive effect on their electorate and cause them to be more open-minded about synthetic biology.Finally, we hope that our project will drive the focus of the synthetic biology more to the topic of safety.The question is if the politicians would introduce our project to their voters as a good example of sufficient safety measures in the field of synthetic biology.It is striking that, even though every different party was skeptical towards our project and genetic engineering in general, the politicians with higher basic knowledge were more open minded towards our project.Only if they are taught about the chances of genetic engineering in a comprehensible manner, we can research the way we do it now in the future as well.But we have to add on this point that experts from the biotechnological industry found a great economical potential in our project.Also we assumed that, in German society, the majority of the politicians would have a negative attitude towards our research.This shows that especially the question \u0091Do you think that presentations or information about scientific projects such as ours can change the position of the electors of your party in a more positive direction in terms of genetic engineering?\u0092 can be answered with a \u0093yes\u0094.Our hope was that with a more positive view towards this topic the interest and the will to learn more about it could be increased.In the scientific world this is a must, but it is hardly useful to present and explain a topic or project to people who do not get in touch with the technical jargon on a daily basis.When we want to excite people for our research and the field of biology in general, we need to make sure we talk about it openly and present it in a way everyone can understand.Due to that fact and the statement of some politicians that a chance of thinking will needtime we have to focus our project towards the industry for the moment.In order to still be able to evaluate how our project is recognized by the public we decided to interview politicians as representatives of people in the general public.And with increasing knowledge the topic of synthetic biology will be discussed more often and in daily life which will eventually lead to a progress in the public.Additionally, the number of people surveyed has to be high enough for the results to be significant, which is not doable for a student team.We also noted that the interviewees\u0092 attitude became more positive after we explained our project.To ensure that our approach is scientifically correct in the field of sociology the questionnaire had to be standardized and the interviewers had to be specifically trained to hold all interviews in the same manner so that every interview could be held under comparable conditions.\u0093This means for us as synthetic biologists that there has to be more enlightenment concerning this topic in general but also from the respective companies.A very big concern the politicians mentioned during the interview, which we would never have thought it even existed, was that our project could be exploited economically.This can be advantageous in a way that it provides a base of opinions which help design standardized questionnaires on this topic in the future.The idea of the Human Practices is to look beyond the daily lab work, reflect about our project and to take it to the outside world.As a tool for standardization, our questionnaire contained a detailed introduction with sufficient comments for the interviewer on how to behave during the interview.To gather the maximum amount of information, the interviews were held in a way that the interviewees could answer as freely as possible.Thus it would be necessary to get someone with a scientific or political reputation to support our project, to convey more seriousness to our research, however, possibly lowering the acceptance of our project again.Thus it is of extreme importance that humanity scholars, media designers and natural sciences students work together to have all the necessary tools for working with society as a whole.In this case it is of importance that this task is performed by people from a different field of study as they know how to explain scientific work in a way the general public is able to understand.Of course these topics are controversial under molecular biologists, but the important question is which intention stands behind the research and if it meets good intentions, so that it can be explained to the general public in an understandable manner.On the other side, this could be used for systematic education about genetic engineering by students for society.Fundamentally, statistics show that genetic engineering is perceived very differently depending on topic and application.We wanted to do a first step in that direction and hope that more teams will follow our way in the future.During our enquiry for statistics we found that there are next to no differentiated surveys about the different kinds of genetic engineering.The most challenging part about the evaluation of such open interviews was to decide on how to interpret the answers to our questions.This procedure was executed so that other teams could ideally re-use our questionnaire and interview under the same conditions as we did, or just slightly change it to survey whole groups of population.Our project would have probably been received better if the interviewees would have known more about the topic.The human practice part of the iGEM competitions is a factor that should not be underestimated.A poll of the IfD Allensbach shows that genetic engineering used for developing cancer treatment meets a positive attitude with 96% of people asked, whereas 74% reject the idea of changing the human genome to increase intelligence[2].To ensure we did it correctly we consulted Dr. Klees, an expert in poll-taking and in addition to that, a social studies student joined our team in order to support us with the evaluations.To also survey the opinion of the voters we used the proximity of the politicians to their respective electorates.They also carry important topics into the general public and thus influence them.Green genetic engineering has the largest amount of polls, also the data about the market share of drugs produced by GMOs is sufficient, but still there are not enough polls about using GMOs for industrial purposes.Our Interviews are, in this manner, guiding towards more target-oriented interviews and studies and can thus be considered a pilot study.In our first discussions we expected the following: First of all, we thought that no politician would know the different kinds of genetic engineering.As decision-makers for laws, regulations and funding in their respective state they play an important role for the future of synthetic biology.This is in controversy to the iGEM idea though.It makes it more difficult to understandably explain a complex project like ours and therefore makes it much more difficult to create acceptance in the public.Thus, our research is a very explorative one in this field.By employing these strict guidelines, we were able to ensure that the interviewer does not forget to list all the important information or influences the interviewee due to lack of experience or nervousness.", "modeling": "(Q) represents the canonical partition function, (k_B) the Boltzman

differences between states with low state space overlap a thermodynamic cycle can be constructed hence the Helmholtz free energy is a thermodynamic state function.The resulting potential energy (U) at state (lambda) is subsequently calculated as a sum of the two end states (U_0), (U_1) and all not decoupled interacions (U_{unaffected}) [16].U(lambda,vec{q}) = (1-lambda)~U_{0}(vec{q}) + lambda~U_{1}(vec{q}) + U_{unaffected}(vec{q})The overall free energy change (Delta A_{0,1}) is consequently calculated as the sum over all free energy changes (eq.This behavior can be traced to the different parametrization approach in the force fields as well as to the fact that the GROMOS56a7 force field is a united atom force field, in which all CH3 and CH2 groups are described as one group.Figure 4: RMSD of miniColicin simulated using the the force fields CHARMm27 (red), AMBER03 (blue) and GROMOS56a7 (green).To obtain the binding energy between miniColicin and the immunity protein we simulated 20 ? states per thermodynamic step.All terms consist of an equilibrium value marked with (0) and a force constant (K) [2,3,4].V_{bonded} = sum_{bonds}{K_{b}(b-b_{0})^{2}} +

force field parameter files.Figure 1: Used atom names and types for the implementation.To implement the newly derived parameters we had to update several force field parameter files that we gathered from the GROMACS\u00a05.0.4 software suite [6-15].This resulted in the empirical force field CHARMm\u00a027\u00a0OMT.3D structures of the Colicin E2 DNase subunit (miniColicin) and its immunity protein were obtained from the RCSB PDB entrance 3U43 [20].Our first simulation analysis led to the conclusion that O-methyl-l-tyrosine had no influence on the immunity protein.To estimate possible influences on the thermodynamics of the system we tried to calculate the binding energy between Colicin E2 and its immunity protein by Alchemistry Free Energy Perturbation experiments.All simulations were evaluated using the BAR scripts from the pyMBAR python library.Three amino acid positions were chosen for O-methyl-l-tyrosine (OMT) exchange evaluation (tyrosine 8 (Y8), phenylalanine 13 (F13) and phenylalanine 16 (F16)).\ref{VV1} & \ref{VV2}) [1].r_{i}(t_{0} + Delta t) = r_{i}(t_{0}) + v_{i}(t_{0})Delta t + frac{1}{2}a_{i}(t_{0})Delta t^{2}v_{i}(t_{o}+Delta t) = v_{i}(t_{0}) +

Colicin E2 DNase subunit and its immunity protein.All molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations (GROMACS) 5.0.3 [6-15] software suite.An

Perturbation (FEP) is a method in computational biology to obtain energy differences from molecular dynamics or Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations between two system states.To avoid this problem, position restraints are added which have to be considered in the final calculation.In order to evaluate the simulations of the intermediate states and calculate the free energy difference between the end states several algorithms have been developed (e.g., Exponential Averaging (EXP) or Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR)).Because of the deterministic nature of the system it is possible to calculate thermodynamic properties like free energy or free binding enthalpies [1].To describe atomistic or molecular behavior the exact system conditions like positions and energies.The mutational variant F16O on the contrary shows a more severe deviation from the wildtype.Figure 2: RMSD of the mutation variants Y8O (green), F16O (blue) and the wildtype (red).The solvent accessible surface area (SASA) was calculated for every simulation step using DSSP and is displayed in figure 3.Additionally the crossing of PBC barriers would increase the distance between two atom positions drastically since the atom would be relocated to the opposing site of the simulated system.Binding energies were calculated by using alchemical Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) in combination with Bennett Acceptence Ratio (BAR).Therefore it cannot evaluate a non-natural amino acid and would cause a discrepancy between surface areas if non-natural amino acids like OMT are involved.Figure 3: SASA of the mutation variants Y8O (green), F16O (blue) and the wildtype (red).Additionally we evaluated the RMSF and the amount of secondary structures over time which exhibited no differences between the mutational variants and the wildtype.\ref{TC}).Delta A_{0,1} = sum^{1}_{lambda=0} {Delta A_{lambda,Delta lambda}}Gibb s free energy differences between two ? states can be calculated by equation \ref{Calc}.Delta G~(lambda^{

interactions.To perform this task we applied several approaches like comparison of the solvent accesible surface area (SASA) over time.The Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) describes the sum of distances of all selected atoms (n) between themselves in a selceted timestep (\tau) and a reference timestep (r) (eq.For homology modeling the Protein Homology/analogY Recognition Engine V 2.0 (PHYRE2) [17] server was used in combination with the amino acid sequence obtained from the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) Protein Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) entrance P04419.The obtained model was based on the known subunits of Colicin E2 and Colicin E3, a close relative.Therefore the dissociation constants were calculated by using equation \ref{gibbs}.No obtainable 3D model of Colicin E2 was found in the Research Collaboration for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Data Bank (PDB) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe) at the European Bioinformatics Institue (EMBL-EBI).Since the main binding occurs between the DNase subunit and the immunity protein only this Colicin E2 subunit was simulated.Plotted over time it is possible to detect fluctuations in the whole molecular configuration and therefore it is possible to conclude structures of high stability from plateaus in the RMSD.By choosing the right atom selection it is possible to evaluate the different behaviours of protein subgroups.In equation \ref{CHARMM_bonded} and \ref{CHARMM_nonbonded} the bonded and nonbonded potentials of the CHARMm force field are displayed.The created topology was then used to derive parameters for the CHARMm residue force field [2,3,4] so that for any protein with O-methyl-l-tyrosine a topology could be created.We tested simulations for different immunity protein variants on different computer systems (workstation and server) with the results being the same.To insert mutations inside the immunity protein we inserted the energy minimized structure of OMT at the desired position.This atom classes represent alanin s C? and the C? atom of methionin.A new atom class named OE was introduced to represent the ether oxygen since there are no ether oxygen parameters for amino acid residues in the CHARMm force field files.Since O-methyl-l-tyrosine is very similar to tyrosine most parameters could be adopted.CHARMm is an atom type based force field, meaning that every parameter is not dependend on the residue but on the assigned atom types taking part in the interactions.First, Colicin E2 s immunity protein was simulated in TIP3P water with 0.6\u00a0nm space between the box and the protein.In contrast to the immunity protein simulations additional restraint decoupling steps were performed over ten simulations before the other steps.Therefore it is important to estimate the influence of mutations on the protein structure.This is important if one wants to search for different thermodynamically stable ensembles of the protein or molecule of interest.Similar to the RMSD the Root Mean Square Fluctuation describes the sum of distances of all selected atoms.Best et al., Optimization of the Additive CHARMM All-Atom Protein Force Field Targeting Improved Sampling of the Backbone phi, psi and Side-Chain chi1 and chi2 Dihedral Angles, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, 8: 3257-3273., 2012[3] A.D. Jr. MacKerell, M. Feig, C.L.Second, the binding complex consisting of Colicin E2 and its immunity protein was simulated under similar conditions i.e.This is particularly true for mutations from natural to non-natural amino acids.To estimate the influence of O-methyl-l-tyrosine on Colicin E2 s immunity protein we applied several molecular dynamics simulations leading to 1300\u00a0ns in total simulation time.In these analyses the translational and rotational movements are not of interest since we only want to visualize the movement of atoms in relation to the simulated protein to test for different configuarations and structural flexibility.This was due to unknown errors, inferior debugging abilities, malformed error messages recieved from the GROMACS simulation package [6-15] and temporal as well as computational limitations.This definition enables the algorithm to distinguish different types of ?\u00a0helices, ?\u00a0sheets, and turns.The electrostatic interations between two groups are calculated by assigning partial charges to each C ((+q_{1})), O ((-q_{1})), N ((-q_{2})), and H ((+q_{2})), with (q_{1} = 0.42~e) and ( q_{2} = 0.20~e) and r(AB) being the distance between two atoms A and B in Angstr\u00f6m.For example, if the RMSD between C? atoms is calculated it is possible to plot the backbone movement over time and hence detect configurations that differ from the starting structure.The main idea to discriminate between different secondary structures is based on the presence of H\u00a0bonds because this can be represented by one energy value.The simulation run with the GROMOS56a7 shows the biggest discrepancy towards the AMBER and CHARMm simulations which display little to no fluctuations over time.First we had to implement the new amino acid in the aminoacids.rtp file which basically serves as a register for all known residues.We used parameters from the generated topology file to derive parameters for all interactions from the OE atom type.Therefore the temperature of the system can be controlled by manipulating the atom velocities.The disparity between the mutational variants and the wildtype can be traced back to the DSSP algorithm since it is based solely on natural amino acids.After neutralization the system was energy minimized with the steepest descent algorithm until it converted.These terms are described in the so-called force field which will be described later on.This ensemble will lead to a clashing of the molecules since the charges will attract each other without any form of antagonistic force.To exclude translational and rotational movement of the simulated protein we applied the GROMACS internal fitting algorithms gmx trjconv -fit rot+trans.This was achieved through the implementation of Kabsch s algorithm for structural alignments in the Bio3D package [21-23] for the statistical computing language R [24].To do this we estimated O-methyl-l-tyrosine parameters for the CHARMm\u00a022 and the GROMOS36a7 force field.The coupling factor ? has been variated ina range of 0 to 1 in steps of 0.2 for Coulomb, 0.05 and 0.1 for the Lennard-Jones interactions respectively.417, 79-94, 2012[21] Grant, Rodrigues, ElSawy, McCammon, Caves, Bio3D: An R package for the comparative analysis of protein structures., Bioinformatics, vol.The energies of an atomic system are described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (eq.Once it has been determined the free energy difference can be calculated by equation \ref{Bennett3} [16].sum_j fleft(U_i - U_j + k_B T~ln frac{Q_i n_j}{Q_j n_i}\right) = sum_i fleft(U_j - U_i - k_B T~ln frac{Q_i n_j}{Q_j n_i}\right)Delta A_{ij} = - k_B T ~ ln frac{n_j}{n_i} + k_B T~ln frac{Q_i n_j}{Q_j n_i}Later on Shirts et al.Since the electrons are far more mobile the dynamic of the system can be defined by the nuclei positions.Therefore the results of these evaluation methods are not shown on this wiki.Closing up we can conclude that the mutational variant Y8O does fit our demands best, since its behavior exhibits the least disparity in our applied evaluation methods towards the wildtype.In this context it was only possible to evaluate a scaling of Lennard-Jones potentials in the range from 0.9 to 1.0 with completely coupled Coulomb interactions.\ref{wavefunction}), kinetic energies (hat{T}_{e}) and (hat{T}_{N}) and potential energies (hat{V}_{e}), (hat{V}_{N}) and (hat{V}_{eN}).10, 845-858, 2015[18] The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.8 Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC.Several different integrators are developed today, of which the velocity-Verlet algorithm is the most used (eq.It can be observed that some deviations between the different force fields occur.To implement these parameters we updated the bondtypes, angletypes, and dihedrals in the ffbonded.itp file.Atom charges were duplicated from tyrosine for all atoms that were not involved in the ether bond.This was due to the case that all parameter files had to be compatible to the GROMACS software suite.The end temperature was set to 298\u00a0K and the Berendsen thermostat and the velocity-Verlet integrator with a stepsize of 2\u00a0fs were used.Positions of backbone atoms were fitted to those of the replaced amino acid so that the backbone integrity was preserved.These conformations were evaluated using RMSD, RMSF, SASA and the amount of secondary structures over time.Figure 2 displays the RMSD in regard to the initial conformation.Finally we had to assign a three letter code to represent our amino acid in the topology and structure files.Fleishman, D. Baker, C. Kleanthous, Structure of the ultra-high-affinity colicin E2 DNase--Im2 complex, J. Mol.The little to no fluctuation in the SASA of all simulated variants is an argument for the high structural stability of the wildtype and the mutational variants.Bonding of proteins is highly depending on structural properties which in turn are determined by the amino acid sequences.Crystallographic structures of the DNase subunit of Colicin E2 and its bacterial import subunit were available.The box was subsequently filled with water and the system was neutralized through insertions of chloride ions.First, we assume in accord with the Born-Oppenheimer approximation that electronical movement has no influence on the overall atomic momentum since electrons will simply follow the nuclear movements in the simulated time scales.The first assumption depends on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be split into two parts, one for the electrons and one for the nuclei respectivly.30, 1712-1718, 2009[17] Lawrence A Kelley,Stefans Mezulis, Christopher M Yates, Mark N Wass & Michael J E Sternberg, The Phyre2 web portal for protein modeling, prediction and analysis, Nature Protocols, vol.If so an evaluation of the configuration space seems to be in order.All-atom empirical potential for molecular modeling and dynamics Studies of proteins, Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 102, 3586-3616.,1998[5] Wolfgang Kabsch and Christian Sander, Dictionary of Protein Secondary Structure: Patter Recognition of Hydrogen-Bonded and Geometrical Features, Biopolymers, Vol.22, 2577-2637, 1983[6] Berendsen, et al., GROMACS: A message-passing parallel molecular dynamics implementation, Comp.The so obtained model was subsequently parsed to the SwissParam [19] topology server.Subsequently we added an OE entry to the atomtypes.atp file.CHARMm simulates aromaticity through dummy atoms which will be calculated automatically.Therefore, it seems appropriate to assume that the unknown error occured due to systematic problems.III Brooks, Extending the treatment of backbone energetics in protein force fields: limitations of gas-phase quantum mechanics in reproducing protein conformational distributions in molecular dynamics simulations, Journal of Computational Chemistry, 25: 1400-1415., 2004[4] A.D.

frac{partial}{partial t}PsiSince there is no possibility to solve these equations numerically, it is necessary to simplify the system description.Afterwards we used PyMOL [18] to create molecular images.A 3D model of O-methyl-l-tyrosine was created using Avogadro 1.1.1, and energy minimized using the steepest descend algorithm in vacuum.Every 5000st step was saved resulting in a trajectory of 10001 conformations ranging over 100\u00a0ns simulation time.Simulation Analysis was performed using the R [24] package Bio3D [21,22,23].Terms with subscript (_{e}) are terms concerning the electrons

protein inspired us to work with UnaG.As part of this iGEM project, research has been done on the newly discovered green fluorescent protein called UnaG.This is the first fluorescent protein to be found in a vertebrate species, giving it a range of biochemical properties that differs from proteins found in the original FP family - one of the most astounding ones being that fluorescence occurs only when a ligand binds non-covalently to the protein, namely bilirubin.Induction of fluorescence of UnaG by the addition of bilirubin.Instead of binding a fatty acid molecule, the ligand of UnaG is bilirubin, which binds non-covalently to the center of this \u00df barrel.During the summer we created three different UnaG biobricks; one with a hexahistidine tag suitable for affinity chromatography, one with the hexahistidine tag and a flexible linker of six amino acids suitable for fusing to other proteins, and lastly one biobrick with only the flexible linker attached to UnaG.This feature could make UnaG suitable as an inducible marker by the addition and removal of bilirubin to cells.In addition to the affinity tag, the original sequence was also modified to include C-terminal flexible linker (GSG)2 in case the protein would be part of a fusion construct.Secondly, it fluoresces only when a bilirubin molecule is bound non-covalently to the protein.The binding buffer for UnaG contains 10 mM imidazole, the washing buffer (to remove the excess protein from the column) contains 20 mM imidazole and the elution buffer contains 350 mM imidazole.This does not interfere with 3A assembly, but a variant of the BioBrick without the flexible linker also exists.IDT sequenced the entire pUCIDT-Amp vector including the ordered insert as part of their quality control workflow, so their results were used as a reference when doing modification to the plasmid.The IDT plasmid contains the lac-promoter so it is possible to do test expression directly with IPTG.UnaG has shown the ability of being fused to other proteins via a flexible linker both on the C terminus and the N terminus, making it suitable to use as a fusion marker.At each step of the experiments, sequencing was performed using the iGEM standard VF2 and VR verification primers to ensure CDS integrity and especially to avoid introduced frameshift mutations.In addition to mutagenesis experiments, small-scale expression tests were performed to verify that UnaG expresses under our laboratory conditions (Kumagai et.al (2013) purified and crystalized the protein from E.coli, so in theory it should be functional in prokaryotes).In the original paper (Kumagai et al., 2013) the authors obtained the UnaG sequence from a cDNA library of unagi eel muscle.The result of the degradation are two toxic compounds; carbon monoxide (CO) and the bilirubin, were as it is only the carbon monoxide that is possible for the body to excrete easily (Mugnoli et al.The pigment also has the ability to conjugate with three types of proteins that are involved in the transport and the metabolism of bilirubin in vivo (Bonnett et al.In addition, none of the fractions fluoresced when bilirubin was added.Since sequencing confirmed that there are no mutations, and we previously managed to obtain impure functioning UnaG during the small-scale experiments of UnaG, the conclusion was that the IPTG solution was faulty and did not manage to induce the T7 promoter driven UnaG expression.Moreover, unlike all other fluorescent proteins of today, UnaG does not need molecular oxygen in order to fluoresce, meaning that it can be used as a marker protein in research under hypoxic conditions.1976).Hyperbilirubinemia, also called Jaundice disease or icterus (www.mesh.kib.ki.se), occurs when either the formation of bilirubin glucuronides or the excretion of these does not work in the correct manner.After successfully obtaining UnaG assembled with a variety of promoters, mutagenesis was performed in order to create several variants of the BioBrick for future use.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0140972 Bilirubin is a yellow pigment (Benioff Children\u0092s Hospital, San Francisco) created by the enzymatic reaction of haemoglobin degradation.There is a slight blue shift in the fluorescence (UnaG is 498/527 nm ex/em and Chlopsid FPI and FPII 489/523 nm ex/em).These contains two glucuronic acids per bilirubin molecule and the compound seems to simply be an effect of bilirubin\u0092s three dimensional structure.One chain of glucuronic acid is enough to make the bilirubin excretable, but diglucoronides can also occur in the human bile.However due to the way the final product is created, the UnaG sequence had a 50% chance to be incorporated in reverse, which was the case.(I)Since UnaG was discovered fairly recently, no mutagenic variations of the protein have been developed with improved characteristics than those of wtUnaG.Consequently the concentration of bilirubin and glucuronic acid accumulates in the body (Buchan, 1826).After the column is equilibrated with ion binding buffer, the buffer it switched out with 0.3 M NiSO4 and a new equilibration step is made with 5 CV\u0092s of ion solution.According to Akiko Kumagai and his team, the quantum yield of holo-UnaG is 0.51 and it is stable in a pH ranging from 4 to 11 (I).UnaG does not seem to be present in any of the fractions 1-7.Afterwards 5 CV of wash buffer is pumped through to remove of all the excess protein still in the column.UnaG is a fluorescent protein that was recently discovered in eel muscle (Anguilla japonica).Since the glucoronic acid contains several COOH- and OH-groups the bilirubin conjugate becomes more hydrophilic than the bilirubin alone.The column is equilibrated with 5 CV of binding buffer, afterward 25 ml of the binding buffer is mixed with the UnaG lysate and loaded onto the column.The researchers suggest that this blue shift stems from the fact that the 57th amino acid in UnaG is asparagine, whereas Chlopsid FPI and FPII contain a histidine at this site.Bilirubin exists in all vertebrates and is a metabolite of the heme group in hemoglobin.Annotations: 2_3F - UnaG

then tested for the target protein using SDS-PAGE.Common properties for these compounds, among which bilirubin is included, is that they can diffuse through biological membranes in the placenta, blood brain barrier and hepatocytes.After centrifugation at 4\u00b0C and 10 000 g for 1 hour, the supernatant was filtered through 0.2 \u00b5M pore filter and loaded to a Ni2+ affinity column, also called IMAC.Alignment of the DNA sequences of UnaG and the Chlopsid proteins show 54% homology.In fact, BR is the actual fluorophore of UnaG.This part has been designed for studying the properties of the protein in vivo, since the high positive charge of the affinity tag could interfere with its function or localization.Upstream of it lies a 6xHis affinity tag, separated by an additional Serine amino acid to increase flexibility between the tag and the protein.When BR binds to the cavity of the protein, it emits green light at 527 nm.Since the haemoglobin is located inside the red blood cells, the protein is hidden from the catabolism.Downstream of the part lies a short Glycine-rich flexible linker to minimize the effects of possible protein fusion.(2015) Adaptive Evolution of Eel Fluorescent Proteins from Fatty Acid Binding Proteins Produces Bright Fluorescence in the Marine Environment.This is part retains all the features, including the RFC25 prefix and suffix, but now the flexible linker is properly expressed and in case of fusing to another CDS would not cause premature termination.Finally, to avoid potential interference from the 6xHistidine affinity tag, BBa_K2003012 was created based on BBa_K2003011.After staining the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and destaining, the band corresponding to UnaG\u0092s expected size (15.6 kDa) was not observed anywhere.The isolation and characterization of bilirubin diglucuronide, the major bilirubin conjugate in dog and human bile.These cool features, alongside the fact that it is always exciting to work with new discoveries, made us want to add this protein to the iGEM toolbox!The UnaG sequence itself was excised from the IDT plasmid using EcoRI and PstI and ligated into pSB1C3 backbone cut with the same set of enzymes.(I)UnaG is a fatty acid-binding protein (FABP).Thereby it becomes possible for the bilirubin to leave the liver and go along with the bile, through the kidneys and then finally get excreted with the urine.In this part, the six amino acids were removed (again through PCR), as well as the Serine linker in between.is almost never present (if so the molecule would have been directly polar and lipophilic) (Mugnoli et al.An exception is an NsiI site in the N-terminal 6xHis tag, but a BioBrick without it was also made.The human being\u00b4s survival is dependent on the monoglucuronides, but not on the diglucuronides (Gordon et al.This protein is interesting firstly because it is about half the size of other fluorescent proteins that are being used today, making it suitable as a fusion protein.In the registry it is annotated as BBa_K2003010.It is only when the exchange into new red blood cells takes its place that the haemoglobin becomes exposed and decomposed by either fagocytosis or haemolysis.1985).Bilirubin is naturally excreted in the liver by, with the help of enzymes, conjugating with the sugar glucoronic acid to create glucuronides.The structure of bilirubin.Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.The molecule has a tendency to form several derivate of bilirubin such as biliproteins, several conjugates and glucuronides etc (Harris, Kellermeyer, 1970).The results verify that UnaG does not fluoresce in absence of bilirubin.Afterwards the column had to be charged with Ni2+ this is done with a ion binding buffer (50 mM Na+CH3COO-, 300 mM NaCl, pH4).This discovery suggests possibilities of changing the emission wavelength of these proteins by mutagenesis comparableto what has been done on GFP for the past 40 years.They contribute to the transport of lipophilic compounds, often fatty acids.To avoid unspecific fluorescence, cell debris were pelleted before the experiment and small aliquots of the supernatant were added to 200 \u00b5L thin-walled PCR tubes.Figure 1.No other fluorescent protein has a ligand that binds non-covalently to it.Therefore suites of different BioBrick promoters were extracted from the 2016 distribution to test for expression.No indications that the diglucuronides are more biological efficient have been noticed so far.It originates from the muscle fibers of the Japanese Unagi eel Anguilla japonica.Even at the pH-values where the COOH-group is in an ionic state the formation of Figure 1C is predominant.In these forms the pigment creates several hydrogen bonds between the NH/O-groups and OH/-groups, which in turn makes the hydrophilic COOH- and NH-groups not available for polar interaction with their environment.The bilirubin molecules have a tendency to create different complexes with other proteins as well, such as serum albumin.Bilirubin does not exist naturally in lower classes of organisms such as bacteria and yeast, so it would have to be added exogenously when research is being done on these types of cells.Bilirubin can only bind to UnaG in its unconjugated (4Z,15Z) form, meaning that wild-type UnaG shows high specificity to this particular molecule.Comparison in different species of biliary bilirubin-IX? conjugates with the activities of hepatic and renal bilirubin-IX?-uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases.The Effect of pH on Green Fluorescent Protein: a Breef Review.The bilirubin is difficult to excrete since it is a non-polar compound and therefor not soluble in water (Fevery, J et al.High levels of bilirubin are toxic and it can result in neurologic harm that causes deafness, delayed development and cerebral pares (Benioff Children\u0092s Hospital, San Francisco).UnaG is a \u00df barrel structure containing eleven \u00df strands - a typical quality for FABPs.Consequently the bilirubin becomes insoluble in water and methanol, but easy to dissolve in chloroform (Mugnoli et al.Chlopsid FPI and FPII are also bilirubin inducible.Note that this part is designed with RFC25 (Freiburg Standard) prefix and suffix in mind, hence it contains additional restriction sites, that do not affect normal 3A assembly but enable in-frame protein fusion without creating stop codons.is present when bilirubin is in liquid and solid constellations (Le Bas, Allegret, et al.Structure of bilirubin IX? (isopropylammonium salt) chloroform solvate, C33H34N4O62?.2C3H10N+.2CHCl3.Acta Crystallographica Section C Crystal Structure Communications,39(9), 1287-1291. doi:10.1107/S0108270183008252Karolinska institutet, https://mesh.kib.ki.se/term/D007567/jaundice-neonatal, Retreived 2016-08-11.Benioff Children\u0092s Hospital, San Francisco.Bilirubin is not very soluble in water, so the stock 1mM solution was prepared in DMSO instead.Breaking open the cells was performed using Qsonica Q700 titanium-tip sonicator since lysozyme has nearly the same size as UnaG and would make purification more difficult, as well as just slower and less efficient compared to sonication.Kumagai, A., Ando, R., Miyatake, H., Greimel, P., Kobayashi, T., Hirabayashi, Y., Shimogori, T., and Miyawaki, A.UnaG does not need molecular oxygen in order to fluoresce, making it suitable for research executed under anaerobic conditions where FPs are not functional.(III)(I) Kumagai, A. Ando, R. Miyatake, H. Greimel, P. Kobayashi, T. Hirabayashi, Y. Shimogori, T. Miyawaki, A.Those include a medium constitutive promoter (BBa_K608006), a strong constitutive promoter (BBa_K880005), IPTG inducible promoter (BBa_J04500), and a T7 promoter (BBa_K525998).", "design": "The feature area is where channels can be placed and is the part of the design which will actually be translated into a PDMS chip.The total running length of the heat shock channel is 2.276 cm and the part of the heating channel which runs parallel with the heat shock channel is 1.41 cm.Figure 2: Final AutoCAD design file for the electroporation chip.However there were still some problems with warping (about one out of four turned out to be good), so we went back to the drawing board to create our finalized design.The basic design is a box which is 2.2x3.3x2.5 cm.The heat shock channel itself is 300 \u00b5m wide at its thin part and 800 \u00b5m wide at the broader parts, it is 500 \u00b5m high in all parts.Early in the summer it was decided that we would primarily work toward creating a functional chip for heat shock, and if there was time to make a electroporation chip and design an incubation feature/chip.The running channels in the electroporation chip are 200 \u00b5m across and 100 \u00b5m high, while the \u0093channels\u0094 where the electrodes are supposed to be placed are 200x200 \u00b5m.The electroporation chip was designed, printed and assembled but there was not enough time to test the transformation capabilities of the design, mainly due to difficulties in getting the electroporation electrodes firmly and correctly attached to the chip.Figure 2: Final AutoCAD design file for the heat shock chip.A schematic view of the heat shock chip can be seen in Figure 2.The feature area is 1.6x3.0 cm on the finalized designs.The inlet channel for the cell suspension is 500 \u00b5m wide and 100 \u00b5m high.Size-wise, these were about 2/3rds of the chip in Fig.This design paradigm was quickly scrapped mainly due to the moulds (and therefore the chips) easily becoming warped during the curing process.The chip in Figure 1 is about 7x3 cm (slightly larger than a microscrope slide).Figure 1: Early design: Easily made and easily warped.Smaller, thicker rectangles.We went over several iterations of designs until we settled on the box designs.The resistor which we added is theorized to produce longer and larger droplets, since these scale with the length of the outlet channel.The total distance that the liquid travels inside the resistor is 103.4 mm or about 10 cm.", "human_practice": "To make an example this manual is made specifically for heat shock transformation, but the design of the chip can be altered to fit any other purpose.When we wrote the manual we wanted it to fit the needs of smaller laboratories that might lack all the necessary equipment and prior knowledge.As a part of Human Practices we decided to develop a manual for manufacturing a microfluidic chip for heat shock transformation.After a short discussion concerning intellegent property and the writing of a contract, our files containing the design of the chip, as well as the manual while it was under progress we re sent to them.The Biohackers at Makerspace are going to test our manual in practice in the near future and we look forward to see the results from our manual and manufacturing method being used.The manual covers the full manufacturing process for a microfluidic chip based on a 3D-printed mold.The collaboration with Makerspace gave us important feedback and lead to an overall improvement of the manual.", "modeling": "The flow rate of the inlets was set to a laminar inflow with average velocity of 10 cm/s and the outlets was set to open.The initial temperature of the whole chip was set 25\u00b0C and the initial value of the velocity field was set to 0 everywhere in the channels.Fig3: Simulation progress after 0.02, 3, 5 and 10 sThe results of modelling the heat shock system can be seen in a real time video at the top of the page.We decided to model our design for the electroporation chip so that we could test out different designs of the chip and view the effects of changing parameters such as flow rate and channels size.Modeling the heat distribution over time in the heat transformation chip circumventedthe technical problems of measuring the temperature inside the channel which proved to be very complicated due to the small dimensions of the channels and a lack of equipment.The main goal of the model was to determine if the structure we designed would be able to generate droplets with our intended values for the flow rate of a dispersible phase, an oil phase, and a continuous phase, cell solution.In our case, we were not able to measure the exact temperature of the cell channel inside our heat shock chip.To set up the simulation we choose time dependent study and the conjugated heat transfer interface which is used to simulate the coupling between heat transfer and fluid flow.That is, your actual values may not be exactly like those shown in the model but the model can give you a good picture of what is going on inside the chip.For the electroporation model we decided to focus on a liquid/liquid interface system as these are generally easier to model and drew the T-junction in COMSOL and assigned correct materials, PDMS, oil and water.The mesh is necessary because COMSOL uses the finite element method, a numerical approach where the problem is divided into smaller parts, \u0093elements\u0094, to calculate difficult partial differential equation systems.After generating the mesh the initial values and the boundary conditions of the problem was set.This means that higher flow rates require a finer mesh and smaller time step in order for the solver to converge.The results of modeling the electroporation system can be seen in a real time video at the top of the page.This is a good approximation for viscous fluids.The boundary of the chip to the surrounding was set to a constant temperature of 25\u00b0C andthe boundary condition of the two inlets was set to a constant temperature of 65\u00b0C to simulate a constant inflow of 65\u00b0C water.With the help of a COMSOL simulation, we could see the heat spreading in PDMS.A mesh was generated of the drawn chip using the inbuilt mesh generating feature with the parameters set to physics-controlled mesh and element size finer.For these reasons, models are a good method of acquiring knowledge about the details of your chip, especially the details that are difficult to measure.Finally an outlet was placed at the end of the main channel.One important aspect of designing the heat shock chip was to determine how heat dissipated in the chip.The initial flow rate for both phases was set to 0 as the two phases flow rate are defined under the inlet panel for each channel inlet.The heat equation of the fluid was coupled with the 2D Navier-Stokes equations for laminar flow.The geometry of the model was built in COMSOL and the domains of the geometry was assigned material specific attributes from the library like heat capacity etc.We focused on modelling the T-junction where the continuous fluid acts on an orthogonal channel with incoming dispersible fluid, leading to droplet generation.In fig 4 the geometry of the t-junction is shown as seen in COMSOL with a blue line representing the initial liquid/liquid interface.Fig4: Geometry of t-junction with initial line liquid/liquid interfaceThe wetting conditions of the walls was set to no slip conditions.The boundary conditions was set to laminar inflow and the average velocity for the continuous phase: 100 nl/min and dispersible phase: 100 nl/min.Droplet formation is thought to occur as a combination of shear stress on the dispersible fluid and a pressure drop when the dispersible fluid droplet has almost filled the entire cross section of the channel.Lastly a \u0093coarser\u0094 mesh was generated with corner refinement around the edges where the orthogonal channel(dispersible phase channel) meets the main channel (continuous phase channel).This was important in order to know if the cells are actually being heat shocked, and at what temperature.By testing a virtual chip system we get both fast and detailed information that is helpful when deciding on the actual parameters of the physical chip.The entrance length can be calculated from the formula 4A/P were A is the cross sectional area of the channel and P the circumference.This method is accurate but also has a high computational cost making it ideal for microfluidics applications where the number of droplets needed to be tracked are few.Generally interface tracking uses a fixed mesh to calculate how the interface changes between two phases.Therefore depending on the interface type, gas/liquid or liquid/liquid, the final model had to be changed to meet the requirement for each type.This structure is critical as the size of the droplets and their flow rate after formation will determine how well the cells is being transformed.It uses the regular heat equation for the heat transfer in solids and the heat equation for fluids that accounts for energy transport due to flow, heat from pressure work and viscous effects that produce fluid heating.The properties for the surface tension was defined by a liquid/liquid system and the library value for the olive oil/water surface tension coefficient was used.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "As a proof of concept we did 2 rounds of experiments on our heat shock chip, one where we compared its transformation efficiency to that of regular heat shock transformation done off-chip and one where we compared transformation efficiency on the chip at different temperatures.During the summer we made over 30 chips and numerous successful heat shock transformations using only 8.4 ng of DNA and 5.9 ?L of competent cells.This waslikely due to the primitive and direct way cells were fed into and out of the chip (usinga syringe to push in/out cells and eye-measuring to see whether cells have entered thechip makes for inaccurate timing and a lot of back and forth).For each transformation at a set temperature the amount of formed colonies can be viewed in figure 3.The average (avg) number of colonies at each temperature drops slightly when going from 55 ?C, 65 ?C to 75 ?C since the latter two contain replicates with zero number of colonies.The avg value for the number of colonies at each temperature was used to determine the average transformation efficiency, represented by the cfu/\u00b5g value and is presented in Table 3.We found that the transformation efficiency was much higher in the conventional heat shock than on our chip.There was also very high variation in the transformation efficiency among the experiments done on on the chip(which were done using similar/identical reagents).Figure 3 shows the data points for the triplicates at each temperature having a large spread of the amount of formed colonies.That is, two transformations carried out on the chip in the same manner could yield a varying number of colonies.The cleanliness of our chip was good as little to no colonies grew on the plates with only SOB run through the chip nor on the plates with only cells (negative control).The plates with bacteria transformed on the chip showed many colonies, considering the small amount of cells and DNA that were plated.On a per plate basis the highest efficiency we had was123 000 and the lowest was 0 (8 out of 50 plates had 0 colonies), with the averageseveral potential causes which could cause this large variation of results.Variation could be due to human error.Here the raw data of every transformation is presented alongside the comparison transformations we did.According to the results presented in Table 1 and Table 2 the heat shock chipdid not reach higher efficiency than conventional methods, at least with the comparison metrics used.The crosses represent each replicate, the circle is a contamination check, and the rhombs are the average amount of colonies at each temperature.The highest average value for formed colonies was at 55 ?C for the heating fluid, giving 30 colonies whilst heat shocking at 65 ?C and 75 ?C yielded 21 and 14.7 colonies.In other words, the transformation worked on our chip and it greatly reduced the amount of reagents needed since colony growth was observed on plates were only 6mL of cell/DNA suspension was heat shocked.The setupof the chip involved running heated water from a beaker through the chip and thismeans that there can be a chance that there is higher or lower thermal leakage thanexpected, leading to the transformation efficiency being affected.55 ?C showed formed colonies for each of the three replicates.Figure 3.Mean transformation efficiencies of the different chips (1-3) and conventional transformations (0).Number of colonies formed after transformation at each temperature.Calculations of colony forming units per microliter DNA were made and the mean for each chip is shown in Figure 1.", "safety": "Besides following standard laboratory safety procedures (gloves, glasses, laboratory coat) we also did the majority of our work in a fume hood or in a \u0093clean corner\u0094.Still we maintained good lab etiquette and treated it with similar safety precaution as we did with E. coli.Acrylamide - The gel used for SDS-PAGE is made from an acrylamide solution.Cured PDMS is also non-toxic and does not have any specific flammability.Chloroform - Chloroform was used for cleaning PDMS, glass/plexiglass slides and the chip molds, especially directly after receiving the molds or directly after a curing of a new chip.To keep bottles of growth media sterile, we used gas burners on the bench.Since chloroform can melt vinyl gloves to the skin we used nitrile gloves when handling it.Whenever liquid nitrogen was used, we made sure to use safety goggles, insulating gloves and worked in a well ventilated area.Nickel Sepharose Fast Flow - Resin used for IMAC loaded with Ni2+ ions is flammable.During work with liquid PDMS we always worked in a fume hood, except when we put the mold inside the laboratory oven.Furthermore we always left all chemicals related to the creating and curing of the chips inside the fume hood, to prevent any gas leaks to the rest of the laboratory.CRISPR systems as Cas9 and CPF1 have the ability to digest DNA, making them a possible mutagen.As a final safety precaution we blasted our guide RNAs against the human genome before we synthesised them, choosing only sequences that had low or no homology.The gas burners were also used to sterilize loops for streaking bacteria and to sterilize glassware at the bench.We used the E. coli strains DH5?, MG1655, BL21(DE3).Even if non-pathogenic organisms are used, some of the reagents can be harmful for humans and the environment.Chief among these were ethanol and 2-propanol, but we also used chloroform during some parts of the summer.Since liquid nitrogen expands a lot when it boils, a special thermos has to be used to ensure that gaseous nitrogen can escape.Before starting the work in the lab, the whole team attended a safety demonstration regarding the lab and lab work.Gloves should always be worn when working with SYBR safe.Liquid nitrogen - We used liquid nitrogen to snap freeze our freshly made competent cells before placing them in a -70? freezer.It should always be handled in a fume hood using nitrile gloves.SYBR Safe - This compound is used to stain the DNA in agarose gel electrophoresis.It is however very unlikely to affect humans (or any eukaryote) as the protein would have to get into the nucleus.The booklet \u0093Common sense for laboratory work\u0094 by IBG, Uppsala University was available in the lab for quick referencing.However protective glasses, gloves and lab coat should always be worn since PDMS is very sticky and can easily stick to clothes or skin, where it is hard to remove and poses a moderate eye hazard.If CPF1 would end up in the cytoplasma, it would then have to be transported into the nuclei for it to be able to cut in the genome.That way, even if CPF1 was imported into our cells and then into the nucleus, it would have no nuclease activity.When possible we forwent the use of chloroform in favor of using 2-propanol or ethanol.During work with microfluidics we used some chemicals for cleaning PDMS, mold, plexiglass and glass slides prior to usage.A lab technician was available during the weeks for further support and questions.The protein would have to be transported over the cell membrane.Working in a lab involves many safety concerns.When handling the organisms, we wore lab coats and gloves when needed.While it is much less toxic and a less potent mutagen than Ethylium bromide, it is by no means completely safe to work with.Since not all team members had previously worked with bacteria or other microorganisms, the more experienced team members taught the others proper sterile technique and how to handle

typically a sequence derived from a viral genome which is used to cleave foreign DNA if the cell becomes re-infected with the same virus.BackRhizobium tropici CIAT 899 is a promiscuous

commercial use in inoculating the common bean Phaseolus vulgaris in South America and Africa (Ormeno-Orrillo et al.1998).Despite its favorable characteristics for basic research and environmental applications, PCC7002s capabilities as a chassis for genetic modification have not been fully realized (Ramey et al.CIAT 899 is more environmentally adaptable when compared to other Rhizobium species due to its tolerance of stressful conditions such as acidic soils and high temperatures (Graham et al.\"Rhizobium tropici, a Novel Species Nodulating Phaseolus vulgaris, L.

identity, and likewise more than half of respondents also want iGEM to improve its discussion on how identity impacts one\u0092s scientific career.After quickly reviewing the history of synthetic biology and its applications in biofuels and agriculture, we dove into a discussion of the ethical issues related to the synthetic production of artemisinin, an antimalarial drug derived from the wormwood plant.During the presentation, Dan gave a quick summary of the history of genetic engineering, and then proceeded to delve into three important applications of genetic engineering: Golden Rice, Artemisinin, and Algal Biofuels.Then we transitioned into a discussion of five important ethical considerations that guide our assessment of emerging technology \u0097 public beneficence, responsible stewardship, intellectual freedom and responsibility, democratic deliberation, and justice and fairness \u0097 and how they might apply to the production of biofuels using microbes.On September 17th, Dan gave an informal \u0093science caf\u00e9\u0094 night at the Center for Engineering, Innovation, and Design at Yale University.While the number of respondents (n = 13) is not enough for the data analysis to be significant, the responses still point to a general desire to improve the iGEM community in terms of its treatment of LGBTQ members.1.The presentation was around 40 minutes long, and included members of the Yale Community.In August, Yale iGEM sent out an anonymous survey to the iGEM community to gauge how open and welcoming the iGEM community is to LGBTQ individuals.The premise of a Science Caf\u00e9 activity is providing an opportunity for the general public to learn and discuss a complex scientific topic in an informal manner.When asked what would foster a more accepting community, one respondent answered, \u0093General community support is one of the best things to foster inclusion (but maybe is the hardest to achieve)\u0085For iGEM specifically, I think talking about these issues and bringing it out in the open will help make a supportive environment overall and at the Jamboree.\u0094This presentation was an adapted version of the SSRI presentation, with a similar outline but leaving out the ethical considerations section for time\u0092s sake.As a result, young lesbians and gays might sell themselves short, aiming for occupations with little use for their talents, but in which they see more people like themselves.\u0094The results of the survey support his statement.The results of the survey show a large distribution in how members perceived their work environment.Dan\u0092s presentation was focused on showcasing the applications and implications of genetic engineering and Synthetic Biology in a relaxed and non-technical way.In discussing biofuels, Dan showed how much more viable algal biofuels were than corn or grain ethanol, and why companies are investing millions of dollars into the technology.The SSRI students asked many great questions about the MAGE cycle, especially regarding the synthetic oligos that are repeatedly introduced into the cells.On July 24, Lionel, Holly, Jessica, and Erin had the opportunity to give a brief overview of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the controversy surrounding them, and our own summer project.iGEM is an ideal organization to survey as it is a small community with members who come from various backgrounds.In talking about Golden Rice and Artemisinin, Dan made sure to highlight two common themes among the problems, Vitamin A deficiency and Malaria respectively, which Golden Rice and Synthetic Artemisinin aim to solve: prohibitive cost of a cure, and lack of sufficient infrastructure for a non-biology-based solution.", "modeling": "We evaluated the above model in a web app which takes in a sequence of DNA, a PCR error rate, and the number of cycles to produce an estimate of the percentage of PCR fragments that contain mutations in the resulting amplified DNA.We formulate the error rate per base as mu, and the length of the sequence in question as G. Then, the error rate per sequence is mu*G. We also take into account the fact that later generations of PCR templates have a higher probability of containing errors.Reliably tracking the mutations created by a MAGE process should take consideration of the errors generated during PCR, given factors such as sequence length, polymerase type, and number of cycles.Thus, the generation of a PCR fragment matters when replication is occurring.These concerns are also accounted for in the New Model.H Sharifian 2010 presents a PCR model based on the Galton-Watson process, where an ancestor particle produces a randomly-distributed number of progeny, which repeat this cycle.Developing a Framework for the Genetic Manipulation of Non-Model and Environmentally Significant Microbes PCR errors are an important problem for all genetic engineering projects, and particularly relevant towards testing MAGE in a new organism.There are a few other factors that need to be taken into account, such as the chance that a strand of DNA is even replicated at all during a cycle.If an error occurs in an early replication it is propagated through subsequent replications and thus this must be accounted for within the calculations.Original samples of PCR fragments stay in the mixture after they are used as templates in the initial round of replication.This branching process can be used to model errors in replication in PCR.This model had similar results to the error rate calculatorhosted by Thermofisher.The parameter k represents the sequence generation, and n represents the number of PCR cycles.Therefore, while a third cycle fragment\u0092s replicated product may have a [1-(0.99)]^3 chance of having a single mutation, there will still be first generation fragments whose replication products will only have a [1-0.99] chance of being mutated.This model is based on a previous model by Sun 1995 [1].With each cycle, PCR errors may occur.", "notebook": "LIC is another high-throughput DNA assembly method which would provide an alternative to Gibson assembly.This week, we continued to make progress in the cyanobacteria and rhizobia growth assays, FLP constructs, cloning, transforming, and antibiotic assays.We started with transforming pCP20, the plasmid containing the FLP recombinase, into two E. coli strains.The project which was started this week focused on porting Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) from E. Coli, in which the technique is proven to work, to Cyanobacteria and Sinorhizobium bacteria.In order to port MAGE from E. Coli to other organisms, we had to first find inducible promoters that worked in Cyanobacteria and Sinorhizobia, and then beta-homolog proteins (reference to MAGE section of our wiki) for both organisms.However, we would need to order new primers and spend a week constructing the LIC vector.This week was centered on characterizing Rhizobia and cyanobacteria, PCR amplifying promoters and citrine, and transforming our plasmids of interest into cyanobacteria and E. coli.For Rhizobia (Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 strains 356, 370, 371 and Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899), we began antibiotic (rifampicin) and growth assays.For both organisms, we started amplifying our control genes of interest (GFP for Rhizobia, citrine for cyanobacteria) with overhangs to the promoters.Much of our transformations this week were in preparation for Exonuclease and Ligation Independent Cloning (ELIC) or for amplification of broad host range plasmids into E. coli.Using electroporation, R. tropici was able to take up the KT230 plasmid, but S. meliloti 356, 370, and 371 demonstrated kan and spec resistance and we were not able to determine whether the transformation was successful for those strains.Experiments for determining growth, transformation, and selection parameters for PCC 7002, S. meliloti and R. tropici CIAT are well under way, but most of us ran into problems with the design and/or the results of these experiments.Erin obtained some unexpected results on her second exonuclease and ligation independent cloning (ELIC) experiment.In regards to non-lab work, we researched and described a way to knock out the mutS gene in both Cyanobacteria and Rhizobia and explored the possibility of also porting a CRISPR/Cas9 system into Cyanobacteria or Rhizobia.For lab work: we successfully miniprepped pKT230 and pZE21G out of E. Coli once the OD was 0.611.For the transformation, we attempted natural transformation of pKT230 and pETcoco-2 into PCC 7002, and we hope to have results next week.For rhizobia, we focused on troubleshooting our unclear electroporation results from last week.Testing the effectiveness of our recombinases will be a bit of a challenge; we need an assay to be implemented in each organism that will allow us to quantify mutagenesis efficiency.While all of this is going on, we will also need to knock out the mutS gene in each of our organisms.Colin also ran a growth assay to test which media was best for growing 7002, and, after some troubleshooting, found that medium A+ was the most useful media for our purposes.We did this for PCC 7002 and S. meliloti (we decided not to work with pKT230-LIC given the instability issues)Isolate and confirm a homozygous ?mutS mutant; characterize mutagenecy of ?mutS mutants versus wild-typeInsert promoter-citrine-terminator constructs into pPZP200b and characterize in S. melilotiConstruct promoter-recombinase inserts and transform into S. meliloti (we need an assay designed for this, which might make this goal risky if it takes a long time to design the assay)Successful plasmid transformation (since it takes 2-3 weeks for transformed PCC 7002 colonies to grow on plates, any experiment that involves transformation is risky at this point)Knock out bacA as a MAGE test (bacA is a possible endogenous target for characterizing MAGE mutagenecy)Promoter-citrine-terminator constructs have been successfully made and transformed into S. meliloti and fluorescence measurements are under way.Promoter-recombinase constructs have been successful made and transformed into S. meliloti and MAGE testing is under way.Once this is complete, we can test the effectiveness of our identified promoters by placing them upstream of a fluorescent reporter; we will use the yellow-fluorescent citrine protein since its emission wavelength does not overlap with the autofluorescence wavelengths of our cyanobacteria.Colin found that growth of PCC 7002 was indeed faster in glycerol-supplemented media (see top two graphs), and confirmed that this growth condition does not shunt away from photosyntheses\u0097for A+ medium, the ratio of chlorophyll to cell density (measured as OD600:OD730 as a proxy) remains constant throughout growth (bottom graph).All of the undergraduate wet lab researchers were gone this week except for Colin.PCC 7002 from the Pasteur collection, but it is backordered and may take some weeks to arrive.We laid out a series of experiments which would eventually allow us to express a nonspecific recombinase (beta-homolog) to incorporate foreign DNA into our organism s genome; this process is at the heart of the MAGE technique.The purpose of LIC is to simplify the cloning of promoter-citrine constructs into our backbone.For cyanobacteria, we decided to use A+ media for culturing because the ATCC media is heavily reliant on seawater, which is variable.To address the issues with contamination, we submitted 16S sequencing of master and working stocks of all our strains and of unexpected growth on selective plates and verified that the stocks we were using were in fact the strains we believed them to be.This week consisted of more troubleshooting for everyone on the team.Regarding electroporation in E. coli, we are still troubleshooting transformations with our two main plasmids pKT230 and k125000.This week we focused on troubleshooting our most pressing problems: growth for cyanobacteria and transformation for cyanobacteria and rhizobia.In our first growth assay, R. tropici CIAT 899 showed growth but the S. meliloti strains did not.We continue to focus on pKT230 and pETcoco-2 as possible backbones for our beta homologs.For cyanobacteria, the amount of time to form colonies on solid media is an obstacle to obtaining results for our experiments, thus we looked into getting a CO2 incubator to promote growth and researched liquid culture selection methods.For ELIC, we chose to work with the plasmid pZE21G as a control experiment; this plasmid along with the chromoprotein amilCP should be able to be successfully assembled.If necessary, the cas9 protein can be placed next to a tetR promoter, a promoter found in E. Coli but not natively in cyanobacteria.He designed a growth assay which he ran on a 96-well plate to characterize the growth of the bacteria in the two candidate media (ATCC 1047 and A+) as well as to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of six antibiotics of interest for PCC7002.This consists mainly of isolating several of the promoters he identified and assembling promoter-citrine constructs.Colin and Danny also went to a hydroponics store to purchase a bright (20,000 lux) grow lamp to place on top of the PCC7002 shaking incubator.The Rhizobium team also conducted selection assays to determine which antibiotics are most effective against Rhizobium tropici CIAT and Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021.The purpose of the rifampicin assays was to determine the antibiotic concentrations our Rhizobial strains were naturally resistant to; we would then be able to use an effective amount for strain selection (MAGE, transformations, etc).We also spent a significant amount of time identifying inducible promoters (either native to our organisms or within the BioBrick Registry) which we could use to express our recombinase.The first step in our plan is to determine optimal growth conditions, transformation protocols, and selection screens for our strains.For the assembly of our promoters and genes into our plasmid backbone, we decided to test ELIC and LIC, cheaper and faster alternatives to Gibson Assembly.Unfortunately, due to a power outage that halted the PCR run, no amplifications were successful.One of the bigger issues we handled this week was the cyanobacteria growth media.We can t be sure which of these factors are preventing successful transformation without further experimentation.While the transformation of plasmids into PCC 7002 was not successful, Colin seems to have success in transforming his linear FLP construct into the cell.We also have the Anderson constitutive promoters from the iGEM registry, which we will use for both cyanobacteria and Rhizobia.None of the pKT230-LIC transformations worked, and RE digest followed by gel-electrophoresis showed that we had once again run into problems with the instability of pKT230: even when the plasmid had the right size going into the LIC cloning, the miniprepped plasmids were markedly smaller.We were also able to isolate the isiAB promoter from Cyanobacteria Synechococcus PCC 6803 using the PCR procedure outlined in the procedural notes.Alternatively, there may exist an incompatibility between the plasmid s origin of replication and PCC 7002 s DNA replication machinery, or the promoter upstream of the antibiotic resistance genes (kanR for pKT230 and ampR for pETcoco-2) may not be active in PCC 7002.Our preliminary results show that many of the UTEX cells form long chains that are difficult to sort so we will need to work on optimizing the protocol.For the conjugations in rhizobia, we sequenced the colonies that grew on the conjugant plates and determined that the colonies were E. coli contaminants.Whether or not pursuing CRISPR would be useful is an idea that needs to be discussed.In order to port MAGE into Cyanobacteria and Sinorhizobia, the mutS gene must be knocked out.We have also experimented with the live/dead sorting protocol (adapted from the LifeTech kit L-34856) to see if we could obtain single genotypes using liquid-only culturing methods because of the inconvenient length of time it takes to obtain single colonies through plating.In rhizobium, Lionel made important progress setting up the LIC cassette in [pKT230] and analyzing electroporation results into the CIAT strain.However, the ends of the promoter were custom-made to be gibson-assembly-ed into the BBa_K125000 plasmid, so if we end up switching plasmids we\u0092d need to re-isolate the promoter.PCC 7002:1) Amplify and assemble KO construct: 1 kb Homology Arm (UpF) ? FRT ? kanR ? FRT ? 1 kb Homology Arm (DownF)6) Flp cuts out kanR cassette, leaving an FRT site scar (Note: Flp-containing plasmid also contains another selectable marker gene, such as spcR)This week, we made progress in amplifying cyanobacteria and rhizobium promoters.The plan is to begin working with our rhizobia strains (Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 and Rhizobium tropici CIAT) next week; we ordered some cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp.Additionally, we have been experimenting with natural transformation in cyanobacteria and are still waiting for the transformation cultures to grow up more before forming conclusions.Following the example of literature, this team inoculated LB broth as well as different antibiotic mixtures of Tryptic Soy Broth and LB with the two strains of Rhizobium we had acquired from the Handelsman lab (Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 and Rhizobium etli CE3).He then confirmed that both pKT230-LIC as well as pPZP200b-LIC could be successfully and consistently electroporated into the electrocompetent R. tropici and S. meliloti respectively that we prepared in Weeks 8 and 9.According to our growth assays, cyanobacteria seems to be the most sensitive to OD 730, so this is the OD we will use for our future assays.We were able to PCR amplify three rhizobium-specific inducible promoters: melA, bacA, and nodF.The growth assays were conducted to figure out the mid-log concentrations and doubling times of the Rhizobia strains.Colin spent much of the week wrapping up experiments and confirming the presence of mutS-free genomes in transformed cell populations from last week.The natural transformation which Colin ran last week yielded partially successful results.Members of the team focusing on PCC7002 studies (Colin, Danny, and Erin) took up much of Dan\u0092s work since he left last week.Colin searched for protocols that could be used for transformation, growth, and various other important processes.For the lab overall, we attempted to electroporate various plasmids into E. Coli to improve our technique.Finally, the AvaI restriction endonucleases present in the PCC 7002 cell may be cutting up the plasmid before it has a chance to replicate.The mutS protein recognizes a DNA mismatch, but since DNA mismatch is absolutely needed for the MAGE mechanism, a mutS knockout (KO) is essential for high mutagenesis efficiency.At this point in the project, we began with finding cyanobacterial inducible promoters.We also continued to look into the efficiency of cyanobacterial growth under CO2 conditions, which according to literature, should be optimized in 3% CO2.With the help of our advisors, we identified goals which we feel are safe to achieve others which were reach targets.The lab had a meeting with our faculty advisors on August 31st to strategize for the upcoming few weeks.However, no CRISPR has been found in the strains of Rhizobia we intend to use.In order to test the ability of the imported CRISPR-Cas systems, we will target the UreC gene, a gene which confers sensitivity to solutions of urea and nickel sulfate.Now, since school was starting, we need to prioritize experiments to get the most out of the project before the Jamboree in late September.Unfortunately, we encountered technical errors with our growth assays so these must be repeated next week.For cyanobacteria, we worked on adjusting the pH of our growing media to standardize growth conditions (pH = 8.5).Already, we have designed the plasmids for the guide RNA and the Cas9 protein.We redid our antibiotic resistance assays (kan, spec, strep, carb, rif) for all strains to confirm innate antibiotic resistances.We set up a growth assay to obtain a growth curve with which we can calculate doubling times and mid-log growth for our Rhizobia strains.Since MAGE is founded upon such mismatches, it is in our best interest to allow them to go unnoticed by the cell s DNA proofreading systems.He identified conjugation and natural competency as two possible methods for getting DNA into the cells, and began experimenting with these procedures.We redid the conjugation, and the results were inconclusive because the negative controls were still able to grow on the antibiotic resistant plates, even when the antibiotic concentration was increased.Holly and Jessica continued working out transformation protocols for the strains, focusing mainly on conjugation.In cyanobacteria, Danny and Colin made important advances in determining optimal growth conditions, setting up a CRISPR cassette, and transforming linear DNA segments into cyanobacteria.Holly obtained inconclusive results in her selection assays (the assays report different resistances for what is supposedly the same organism), which may be an indication that the frozen stocks from which she was working are contaminated.The next challenge is to PCR-screen single colonies of cells grown on plates to isolate a homozygous genotype.Ariel and Natalie also worked to assemble promoter-citrine constructs and amplify beta-homolog biobricks for submission to the parts registry.1).Since each PCC 7002 cell has 5 to 6 chromosome copies, no cell may be homozygous for the mutS knockout.MutS functions in the DNA mismatch repair pathway, which is a highly conserved system from prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes.We found a protocol for conjugating E. coli to UTEX 2973 and began to incubate E. coli containing pKT230.2 When UTEX 2973 reaches OD750 0.5, we will proceed with conjugation.We performed several rhizobium antibiotic resistance assays to determine whether our strains of rhizobium have natural resistance to certain antibiotics.This was compared to the growth of UTEX 2973 (another fast-growing freshwater cyanobacterium).1) returned the expected result of zero colonies.Colin continued characterizing the growth and selection parameters for PCC7002 in the shaking incubator with ambient air (no supplemental CO2).The pPZP200b-LIC transformations all worked, but we had low levels of fluorescence in line with the E. coli readings, with fluorescence observed for tac, AS and AM.From our antibiotic assays, we determined that all antibiotics tested were effective at high concentrations (4x the standard E. coli concentrations).This could be due to multiple factors: The plasmids, which are both around 11kb, may be too large for the cell to absorb naturally.Kanamycin s power for selection is promising, since it is the antibiotic most often cited in PCC 7002 transformation protocols and our FLP construct contains a kanamycin resistance cassette.This was confirmed by PCR amplification of the mutS region of transformed cell populations and control populations (Fig.Neither of the linearized plasmids which he tried to transform (pKT230 and pETcoco-2) seem to be able to propagate in the cell.Fluorescence for the same inserts was markedly lower in pPZP200b-LIC, possibly because of the lack of a downstream terminator.Dan worked on amplifying them so that they can be assembled with citrine into one of the vectors we have and tested for strength.Lionel spent much of his time in the Dellaporta lab working out LIC procedures.We have furthermore been able to BsaI digest pKT230 and ligate the LIC cassette and the T7 terminator into it.This means that cyanobacteria are prime targets for the porting of CRISPR- Cas systems.Furthermore, the construct seems to have recombined successfully with the genome, resulting in kanamycin-resistant cell populations (Fig.This effort will continue in the following weeks and when all of the undergraduate researchers return to campus.Between Aug 10 and Aug 28, Lionel found time to continue working on the project.We re-streaked strains obtained from the Jacobs-Wagner lab in case our stock cultures were contaminated.We researched and found the reagents necessary to prepare MN marine medium from a seawater base in our lab.Our rhizobium transformation experiments gave us mixed results.(R. tropici is already resistant to the spec marker on pPZP200b-LIC, while S. meliloti is already resistant to the kan marker on pKT230-Lic.)The Cas9 protein then causes a double stranded break in the DNA (see the graphic below put together by the Wuhan University iGEM team in China).We set up another antibiotic assay and we are awaiting results.For transformation, we decided to try chemical transformation (CaCl2 method) and conjugation in addition to electroporation.We decided that the best way to do this would be with a Flp-FRT Recombination.We also focused our efforts on growing up copies of a backbone plasmid, BBa_K125000, which was to contain our primers.This week served as an orientation and planning period.Dan began his research for the summer two weeks before the other researchers arrived.We found promoters in Cyanobacteria which should, in theory, be inducible, and one constitutive promoter.The graduate mentors showed us around our lab space, and we practiced some lab techniques (such as proper aseptic technique and a transformation protocol in E. coli) with the Isaacs lab graduate students.With LIC, the BsaI T4 DNA polymerase generates long complimentary sticky ends between the vector and insert and eliminates the need for ligase.While initially the FLP construct PCRs for cyanobacteria and rhizobia did not yield excellent results, we have successfully amplified the linear FLP construct for cyanobacteria.Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 showed growth in all three mixtures of media; however, it showed the fastest growth in 50% Tryptic Soy Broth/ LB.For Cyanobacteria, Dan inoculated both Synechocystis sp.Silencing mutS should allow us to do this.For Rhizobium, Holly, Lionel, Jessica, and Erin tried to determine the optimal growth conditions.Guide RNA locates a specific homologous sequence in the DNA following a PAM sequence.CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is a recently discovered mechanism from certain bacterial adaptive immunity systems that uses guide RNA and the Cas9 proteins to create gene knockouts and gene replacements.Rhizobium etli CE3 showed no growth, and, therefore, was dropped as a target for research.",

can be found 3 essential domains: the condensation (C), adenylation (A), and thiolation (T) domains which all work together to add one amino acid to the growing peptide chain.These large synthetases are composed of a string of modules where each module is responsible for the addition of one amino acid to the growing peptide chain, similar to the function of transfer RNA (tRNA) and codons in ribosomal peptide synthesis.Vancomycin (left) and cyclosporine A (right), two therapeutic compounds that are NRPS-synthesized and both contain cyclic structural components (a common characteristic of NRPS products).NRPS systems are a source of antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer compounds that are important to the pharmaceutical industry.The final domain of the last module in each NRPS system is usually the thioesterase (TE) domain, which facilitates the release of the final peptide product through hydrolysis or macrocyclization, resulting in a free linear or cyclized peptide chain.Figure 3.Each module is composed of multiple catalytic domains, each carrying out a specific function during the addition of a new amino acid.Greater than 70% of these essential compounds are commonly found in the bacterial kingdom and a significant portion are produced by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs).(Shown left) Nonribosomal peptide synthetases contain multiple modules, with each module containing several catalytic domains (shown in different colours) each responsible for a specific function.To extend from this, useful but toxic NRPs could be modified through the addition or removal of specific funtional groups in an attempt to maintain biological activity while also reducing toxicity.Both the C and A domains contain residues that confer specificity to the amino acid being added by the module.The condensation (C) domain is responsible for coupling the new amino acid to the previous amino acid of the peptide chain via dehydration reaction, forming a new peptide bond.The thiolation/peptidyl carrier protein (T or PCP) domain propagates the growing peptide chain using a mobile thiol arm, which swings to transfer the peptide chain from one module to the next.Tyrocidine (shown right), for example, is another antibiotic nonribosomal peptide but, unlike vancomycin or cyclosporine, is toxic to the human body.Furthermore, the study of NRPS systems could give the scientific community insight into the evolution of NRPS systems in bacteria and fungi and perhaps use it as another measure of relatedness among species or strains of the same species.Such NRPs could find a niche use in a therapeutic or industrial setting.", "description": "One other reason behind further investigating the oxidation domain in IndC, the NRPS module responsible for indigoidine synthesis, was because the exact mechanism of indigoidine formation was unknown.It has been debated whether the oxidation domain acts on the cyclized final compound as seen in other FMN-dependent oxidation domains found within NRPS systems, or whether it would oxidize the glutamine attached to the PCP.Therefore, one possibility we wanted to explore was steric hindrance of the oxidation domain found in the IndC module incorporating indigoidine.This leads us to believe that the TE domain would cyclize glutamine, which would then be oxidized by the oxidation domain in order to spontaneously combine into indigoidine.From this hypothesis it is noted that the oxidation domain in IndC most likely works on the glutamine while it is tethered to the PCP.However, the pyroglutamine was soluble in water and insoluble in DMSO, opposite of what indigoidine was found to be soluble in in literature [2].There is a decrease in absorbance for the enzyme plus pyroglutamine, which one might expect if the indigoidine being formed was precipitating out of solution.Our first hypothesis was the former mentioned above, that the oxidation domain acts on the cyclized product after it is released by the thioesterase (TE) domain.It was noted however that there was no paper published on the ability of indigoidine to tag NRPs, nor were there any nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or mass spectrometry (MS) data present to demonstrate its ability to tag NRPS.NMR was carried out in order to determine if the compound we ordered was indeed pyroglutamine.If that is the case it would most likely fix the glutamine in a cis configuration, bringing together the residue amine group to act as an intramolecular nucleophile in order to finalize the cyclization of pyroglutamine.The pyroglutamine had a blue colour in solution with absorbance similar to indigoidine at 600nm.This hypothesis was derived from the fact that cyclized glutamine was observed as the final amino acid in the molecule Padanamide B.To test this new hypothesis, we are currently synthesizing a S-N-acetylcystamine (SNAC), which mimics the phosphopantathiene arm found on the PCP.The use of peptide SNAC to probe NRPS domain substrate specificity has been previously demonstrated [3].In 2013, Heidelberg iGEM introduced indigoidine tagging of nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) to the iGEM community.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,\u00a0101(44), 15585-15590.The oxidation domain was ordered from IDT and cloned into a pET-16b vector containing a 10x C-terminal His tag.The purified oxidation domain contained a yellow colour demonstrating that it was co-purifying with bound FMN.As seen from above there was no increase in absorbance as one would expect.Hahn, M., & Stachelhaus, T. (2004).Despite the solution containing a blue colour, no traces of indigoidine were observed.", "design": "", "human_practice": "Promoting the future of NRPS systems, we explained how our project would allow for the engineering of these systems for the ability to create new drug products with new properties by re-coding the DNA of the NRPS using synthetic biology tools.APSC 100 is a first year engineering practice course taught at Queen s University.We received great reviews from the students on the course and it was a pleasure to teach students so eager to participate and learn!This year, Queen s iGEM directed a two-part interview series to suppliment our project focus on novel drug discovery and optimization, touching on overarching questions related to biosynthetic production, drug design, metabolite reprogramming, and much more.By incorporating synthetic biology and the considerations of our work into an engineering project, we hope to introduce the students to the possibilities of merging applied science with more traditional forms of research, promoting interest in the biological applications of engineering.This summer, QGEM hosted three week-long synthetic biology courses for middle school and high school students through the Summer Enrichment Experience at Queen s (SEEQ) program hosted by the Enrichment Studies Unit (ESU).We also introduced students to the basic concepts of synthetic biology (fusing biology with engineering) and organized class discussions on the ethics and societal implications of synbio research.Some of the activities our students engaged in include building DNA double-helices using Twizzlers (left) and creating their own eukaryotic cell model using dessert treats (center-left).Life Sciences, Queen s University (2015), Ph.D. Molecular Biology and Bioengineering (2015-present), University of California, Berkeley.On September 28th, 2016, QGEM hosted a public seminar to encourage members of the Kingston community to learn more about synthetic biology and its fascinating applications.While engineering is a key component of the design and modelling aspects of our project, the team has traditionally struggled to breach the gap between the biological sciences and engineering within the university.We explored these topics through the perspectives of both research and the industry, integrating themes such as innovation, design, commercialization, and future outlook of drug development and biosynthetic engineering.This year (2016-2017), QGEM entrusted APSC 100 students with the task of designing and producing either an incubator, a thermocycler, or a transilluminator in the most efficient way possible, integrating skills from their other courses.We believe that synthetic biology is the future, and therefore educating young people about it is a crucial component to raising public awareness.Although students in grades 6-8 experience a very basic science background by virtue of the curriculum, they were eager to learn from our presentations.It is also an excellent way to promote iGEM to high school students on the verge of attending postsecondary institutions, for which they will have gained prior exposure that can potentially influence them to join iGEM.In this interview, we discussed with Dr. Adams about the challenges he faced in the drug development process.Background: B.ScH Physiology & Pharmacology, University of Western Ontario (1979), Ph.D. Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Western Ontario (1985), Post-Doctoral Fellowship, Baker Medical Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia; Supervisors: Alex Bobik and Paul I.

enzyme in the NAD biosynthesis pathway, thus maximising the yield of this valuable metabolite.In our experiments, we fused CRY2 and CIB1 to CFP and YFP (respectively) to see if the CRY2/CIB1 system was expressed and functional in E. coli by FRET analysis.Further, CIB1 fragments showed significant proteolysis, suggesting that despite the strong YFP expression seen in the FRET tests, the CIB1 fusion module may not be intact and able to associate with CRY2.Overall, while we succeeded in creating and expressing our CRY2/CIB1 reporter FRET and CRY2/CIB1-Cre-recombinase constructs, insolubility of CRY2 and proteolysis of CIB1 suggests that they would not be able to associate upon blue-light induction to form a functional system.However it was possible to record FRET tests using fluorescent proteins fused to CRY2 and CIB1 despite a large fraction of CRY2 being insoluble.These tests suggested that an energy transfer event occurred when compared to background dilution effects, which may involve the FAD chromophore of CRY2.Assaying the functionality of the CRY2/CIB1-Cre-recombinase system presented another roadblock: even without any induction, our reporter construct (loxP-flanked RFP followed by a kanamycin-resistance gene) showed leaky read through, which was not reduced by the addition of a promoter after the first gene.The A. thaliana photoreceptor CRY2 and its binding partner CIB1 offer a rapid, reversible system for the control of cellular activity, through the fusion of split effector proteins that are reconstituted upon illumination with blue light.We propose the use of an optogenetic device to ensure that an essential late-stage enzyme involved in the production of a potentially toxic metabolite is expressed only at the optimal time.Our

thus, this is the terminus we also worked with.It is, however, worth noting that this procedure overestimates the size of particles, and so any measurements of OMV size we show on our Wiki are larger than the true size.From Schwechheimer & Kuehn, 2015 [4]TolA is also part of the Tol-Pal complex.We hope this will serve as proof of concept for the potential for OMVs to be tailored for various functions in future projects.Currently, synthetic biologists engineer live bacterial cells to perform new or useful functions.The final stains we thus obtained are shown in the table below: TolR (periplasmic domain) or g3p (N-terminal domain) were expressed in a T7 promoter-driven vector (pET or pRSF Duet, respectively).OMVs are non-living and non-replicating, and therefore following potential release they will eventually degrade with no long-term effect on the natural ecosystem.Instead, the ?tolA and ?degP E. coli strains were obtained from the Yale CSGC (Coli Genetic Stock Centre).Particles appear individually as point-scatterers, moving under Brownian motion which is recorded as a video which can be analysed by the provided software (Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) Version 2.3).These knock-in mutations were selected for our strain library as they have both been demonstrated to destabilise the outer membrane of numerous gram negative strains and induce increased production of OMVs.To thus make this part more usable in 3A assembly, we submitted a new construct to the registry (BBa_K2022002) with the above conditions, and went so far as to characterise it and confirm its role in the cell!Previously, Paris 2009 had submitted a domain of the E. coli protein TolR to the registry as BBa_K257005.This should export RFP to the periplasm via the Sec pathway [7].Filamentous phage infection: crystal structure of g3p in complex with its coreceptor, the C-terminal domain of TolA.This means, for example, instead of looking at the top of a cell, it can look inside and see its cross-section.Attachment protein g3p has been shown to interact with TolA, a protein which confers outer membrane stability.We would like to thank EnGeneIc Pty Ltd for their expertise in the use of the LM20, and for the assistance of their staff in running our samples on the machine.We aimed to localise RFP to the periplasm through the attachment of a Sec-signal tag from the pelB leader sequence.DegP is an envelope stress-inducible periplasmic chaperone-protease, and previous studies have shown that ?degP mutants produce higher levels of OMVs [6].We would like to thank the staff at UNSW\u0092s Biomedical Imaging Facility for training us in the use of this expensive instrument, and equipping us with the skillsets to use it independently.Meanwhile, GFP was fused to the C-terminus of the Ice Nucleation Protein, N- and C- termi (INPNC).However, these bacteria are limited to use in the laboratory as their release poses severe biosafety risks since they may persist in the environment long after their function is required.All the above is also documented on Paris 2009\u0092s part page.Deatherage B. L., Cano Lara, J., Bergsbaken, T., Rassoulian Barrett, S. L., Lara, S., Cookson, B.

Also, regarding our new Duet Expression Plasmids, we miniprepped colonies, ran these on a gel to confirm their sizes, digested to open them up to our insert, and finally phosphatase treated.We finally decided to pull the plug on the CRISPR side of our project; it d simply proven too fiddly and tough to optimise.We also transformed our tolR and g3p expression products into the expression strains, ready for further analysis next week!We ran into a roadblock where our double transformants (with both Cas9 and any of the sgRNA plasmids) began to grow really slowly, taking days to appear on the relevant double-antibiotic plates.For DegS, we miniprepped and submitted the product for sequencing at the Ramaciotti Centre We used PCR to amplify the parts received from IDT: expression constructs for g3p, tolR, and alMGS.However, we realised once we got there that we forgot to bring our negative control - a strain with just RFP - and so the strength of our data was weakened.We first sequenced our expression strains to check for the genes degS, degP, and tolA.On Tuesday, we received 12 more GBLOCKs from IDT (for inducible or membrane-localised parts), which we PCR amplified, digested, and ligated into the BioBrick plasmids.As for pKD-sgRNA-tolA, we wanted to put them into the expression strains that already had the pCas9 plasmid, but these stubbornly grew really slowly in and were unable to reach the correct OD to make them competent.More colony PCRs this week!With the help of our advisor we sent in one of these bands to the Mass Spectrometer (which later came back negative).The following day, we reran the protein samples on the SDS-PAGE, and this time performed a Western Blot, with the primary antibody targeting g3p s and tolR s His-tag.This was a simple first pass at comparing OMV production between delta-tolA, delta-degP, and a negative control, but the data pointed to a need for further testing when we get a different set of filters.And on Wednesday we went back to the Airyscan microscope, this time to image our harvested OMVs at high resolution.We also ran more pkD-sgRNA-TolA minipreps on gels and submitted them for sequencing at the Ramaciotti Centre Beginning Monday, we started screening last week s transformants from for the presence of the alMGS or g3p inserts we wanted; this involved colony PCRs and submitting for sequencing.By Friday, though, our cells started growing at a normal rate, the result of much retransforming, restreaking, and reculturing, and so we activated the Cas9 plasmid to knockout DegS and DegP.From the overnight cultures of last week, we made minipreps.For each we identify one with the correct sized insert, and so we miniprepped, PCR amplified the insert, and submitted for sequencingAt the same time we also began working on isolating our alMGS-bearing cells.We also rehybridised the SLiM PCR products for tolA and retransformed them into our cloning strain, but no colonies grew; we believed that there was something wrong with the primers, so we designed new ones and put them on order.We digested with DpnI the products of these PCRs to remove reaction template, and ran a 3-hour long PCR reaction that hybridised the reactants together.These were then transformed into the cloning and two expression strains.Once we managed to grow them up sufficiently, we performed a colony PCR to sequence their plasmids and double check that everything was perfectWe took a new approach to fusing the two alMGS fragments into the full gene: amplification using 5 -phosphoprimers, such that the two products could be ligated together.It was an enormous effort, though, so despite the setbacks we were all proud To put our six parts into the expression vector, we did exactly the same process as above, only using different primers for the initial PCR amplification (to add on specific restriction enzyme sites), and the above step (2) was not needed.We did, however, have more luck with g3p and tolR, as we digested their PCR products with EcoRI and PstI, ligated them into the linearised plasmid backbones from the DNA distribution kit, and transformed them into our cloning strain.We still managed to transform the pCas9 into the two protein expression strains: NEB T7-Express, and Thermofisher BL21-StarAll we managed to fit in was making glycerol stocks of all the plasmid-bearing cells we ve prepared thus farWith exams finally ending, we sat down to plan where we would be going over the next few weeksWe (finally!)It was her first time flying solo with the AiryScan confocal microscope, and her machine time was limited on the day, meaning that the images turned out too blurry to be conclusive and strong enough to submit - while the E.coli were imaged well, we just couldn t get enough clarity to see smaller OMVs (if they re actually there...).So we got a new gel tank, reran the colony PCRs, and finally identified a putative positive hits for two of our g3p constructs and one of our tolR constructs; we then miniprepped the plasmids from these.Unfortunately, while the positive control sample worked, we couldn t detect either g3p or tolR, implying that they weren t being expressed.And, to cap off a busy week, we transformed J04450 (RFP), J23119 (a promoter), B0034 (RBS), and B0017 (double terminator) into our cloning strain, for later BioBrick assembly.While still figuring out how to accelerate our cells  growth (or, at least, return it to a normal rate for E. coli), we remade the sgRNA-tolA plasmid (see Week 6), and transformed it into our cloning strain.By Friday we were exhausted of repeating the same procedure over and over again, but we managed to PCR amplify the insert (again) from these minipreps, and submit them for sequencing - always good to get more confirmation than just size!We ran a gel of what we thought should be new pKD-sgRNA-tolA and -degP plasmids, but no band appeared.We miniprepped two of these, performed a PCR to sequence the insert, and at the end of week received sequencing data confirming that these were both successfully inserted.During the week we also tried a simple assay for quantifying OMVs.Unfortunately, we only imaged strains lacking any hypervesiculation modifications, as we only had 30 minutes of microscope time and merely wanted to check if the dye workedThis week was devoted to sorting out whether our Cas9 system actually was operation, and to do so we devised a series of tests.We then miniprepped all these colonies, and performed the same PCR on the pure plasmid template, but saw the same pattern of bands; the consistency of this perhaps hinted at contamination of the primers, but more than likely it was due to some quirk of the sequence.As mentioned elsewhere, we acknowledge that the genetic background of these strains will be different to those in which we will test our other parts, which will present somewhat of a confound, but we believe that collecting the data but making that caveat clear is still important Charlotte managed to take images of the DegP KO that recently arrived.We then transformed these, and pick n patched for single colonies which we could begin to screen.On Friday, we tested out our FN-464 membrane dye under the confocol microscope.This involved performing colony PCRs to amplify the insert, running the products on a gel, and observing for the correct size.We concluded that the new backbone preparation we used was not working well, and, given how little time remained, we decided to step back to transforming using the iGEM-supplied linearised backbone.At the same time, we ordered primers for making a pKD-sgRNA-degP plasmid, to knockout a related protein to degS called degP.For alMGS, we reattempted fusion of its two fragments via overlapping PCR.We thus had to isolate single colonies by restreaking, but also began to screen for successes using colony PCR to check the size of the genes (knockouts being smaller).We then realised that we used the cloning strain for our expression test, which lacks the ability to be induced by IPTG...We thus miniprepped the plasmids out of these, and transformed them into the expression strain the next day.We miniprepped a few of the transformants, and verified them by running on a gel and submitting for sequencing.Much of our time was then devoted to designing primers to make our existing parts compatible with these Duet plasmids, as our intention next week is to start cloning our genes into this, and hopefully successfully express that wayWe set aside Tuesday for another growth rate analysis of our Cas9-edited cells, as per Week 15.Unfortunately, we saw nothing, and upon further digging realised that the microscope could never hit a good enough resolution to clearly resolve OMVs, which typically average around 15nm in diameter.Again, the data were inconclusive, leaving us with no direction for this part of the projectStarting Monday, we began rescreening colonies to find those bearing our T7-controlled construct.In what was good news, though, we managed to order the gene in from fragment from IDT, negating the need to fuse it together, hence we decided to wait until that arrived.We made competent the cloning strain bearing either g3p or tolR expression constructs, and transformed these with RFP-expression plasmids.Results were inconclusive...To start the week, we received sequencing results telling us that our alMGS insertions were, well, junk, as they came back with a sequence matching to nothing.We tried a gel extraction of the correct-sized band, but the gel itself had an unexpected error and we lost all our product...Here, we reattempted Gibson ligations and transformations to put missing parts into pSB1C3, and began the screening process by colony PCRs.We also completed two runs of harvesting OMVs, using our latest protocol with a 100kDa filter.For the latter, we tried several overlapping PCRs to fuse the parts together, but gels revealed bands running at incorrect sizes.These were transformed into our cloning strain, streaked out for single colonies, and miniprepped to build up stocks.We took last week s minipreps and ran them on a gel.The first of these was given to the team at EnGeneIc to image using their Nanosight, while the rest were used for nanodropping, to test whether this could be adapted to measure OMV concentrationAnd in the few hours before Wiki freeze, we will be going to the Airyscan microsope for one last run.See more at our Public Engagement page!This week, we made plasmids expressing sgRNAs that target TolA and DegS in the E. coli genome.To do so, we first grew up our cells with TolA inserted into the Duet vector, and induced at OD 0.4 with 0.5mM IPTG.To put our six parts into pSB1C3, we started from scratch: 1) PCR amplify six of our synthesised parts, 2) PCR amplify the backbone, 3) digest both with EcoRI and PstI, 4) phosphatase-treat the backbone, 5) cleanup both, 6) ligate, and 7) transform.As above, this didn t work eitherWe first retried reinserting our parts into the Duet expression vectors, but this time we ligated using a Gibson.We continued with the screening process from last week, and eventually found the final putative positive hits that had the correct size insert.Hence, we retried entire conversion process (see Week 6), got a positive result, and then DpnI digested it.It s tough to get this heartbreak so late in the project, but we had to look for alternatives and located a device called the NanoSight, which we will try next week.The final week of iGEM saw us in a mad rush to finish parts.Then, on Thursday, we received two new plasmids: pET-Duet, and pRSF-Duet.On a nicer note, sequencing results revealed that -degS plasmid had been taken up by transformants 24, 25, and 26, and so we could continue working with these.We began to screen more and more colonies for their sizes using colony PCR and gels, but the bands came back in a range on inconsistent sizes - despite testing white colonies that should show no self-ligation.Hundreds of transformants were made, and we stayed in late screening as many as we could using colony PCRsAnd we got several hits!We then tried a PCR on the overlapping PCR s product, hoping to amplify the full product specifically from the mix; this only marginally improved the outcome, so we did another PCR using that as template, only to again see little improvement; so we shelved work on alMGS for now.About twenty transformants were made, but colony PCR revealed they had not taken up the insert.Unfortunately, the TolA product failed to work, so we retried the process; a gel then revealed that no DNA was present, so we ordered new primers for the SLiM reaction.As such, we redid the Gibson ligation reaction for these plus (g3p, and periplasm-localised RFP), this time doing an overnight DpnI digest to lower the background, and balancing the stoichiometries as best we could.First, we cured both of our expression strains of a thermolabile plasmid - this gave us a plasmid-free version (tested for its antibiotic sensitivity) of the expression strain, to use as a negative control.Running the results on this procedure on a gel revealed the same result as last time - the reactants were still present at a much higher abundance than the product we wanted (i.e.We induced the system and looked on an SDS-PAGE for extra bands; we compared the growth rate of the cells with or without added aTC (which would reactivate the system and cut the genome); the rate of growth would be proportional to the percentage of cells that had already been cut, as they would be immune to recutting).Three of us tried to clone our constructs into pSB1C3 (to submit to the registry), and the other three put it into our Duet plasmids (to express).Further, we began work on a part we received from the registry: INPNC.We also began to harvest OMVs using our centrifugation protocol And, due to the folding of the CRISPR team, all hands were devoted to cloning and expressing our parts.As this week rolled in, we finished colony PCRs for all our remaining transformants with Gibson plasmids (and there were well over 100).However, we didn t use them in any labwork, merely planning out the best approach, hoping to start fresh next weekTwo big events this week!For these, again, we miniprepped the plasmids, PCR amplified the insert again, and submitted them for sequencing.Rather than test for expression via SDS-PAGEs, we began to look for GFP expression under UV lamps, but couldn t see anythingWe also began the arduous task of harvesting OMVs from our KO strains.We also ran a separate SDS-PAGE to transfer to a Western Blot, but again we were unable to detect our proteins.On Tuesday we redid our activation of Cas9 in all three cell lines, for knocking out degS or degP (i.e., six knockouts in total).After a night of growth, we spun down briefly to pellet the cells, and ran the supernatant through a 0.22 micron filter.However, running the product on a gel revealed that the reaction didn t complete and still contained more reactants than products.", "protocol": "", "result": "When we combine these data with the above, tolR increases both the number and size of particles, and thus the number and size of OMVs, hence it is an effective part for inducing hypervesiculation.Figure 6: Size distribution of OMVs, comparing NEBT7 E.coli with g3p either induced or not inducedLikewise, induction of g3p expression was shown to increase the size of particles, with peaks shifting from 77nm to 102nm.These expression plasmids were transformed into NEB T7 competent E. coli cells, and ?degP or ?tolA knockout strains, and expressed as seen belowProtein Expression: SDS Page, and Mass SpectrometryExpression of tolR, g3p, INPNC-GFP and PP-RFP was tested in NEB T7 E. coli by inducing T7 polymerase expression with 1mM IPTG.Protein samples were extracted from each of these cell types after 3 hours of induction, run on an SDS PAGE gel, and stained with GelCode Blue Protein stainFigure 3: SDS PAGE checking expression of g3p, TolR and INPNC-GFP in NEB T7 E. coli.Final assembly of these plasmids was achieved using Gibson assembly.Figure 2A: Gel electrophoresis showing PP-RFP (lane 2, 1203bp) and INPNC-GFP (lane 3, 2133bp) inserted into the pET Duet expression plasmid.Samples are: Control = NEB T7 E. coli; g3p (non-induced) = NEB T7 + g3p; g3p (induced) = NEB T7 E. coli + g3p + 1mM IPTG; ?degP = ?degP E. coli; ?tolA = ?tolA E. coli; ?tolA + tolR (induced) = ?tolA E. coli + TolR + 50mM arabinoseHere, the height of the bar indicates the number of particles (in the hundreds of millions) that the nanosight detected in each sample, where the assumption is that the number of particles strongly correlates with the number of OMVs in that samples.Below are a the size distributions of particles detected by the NanoSight in each sample.Figure 5: Size distribution of OMVs, comparing ?tolA E. coli to ?tolA E. coli expressing tolRAs seen in figure 5, expression of tolR shifts the peaks of particle size to 130nm, 170nm, and 310nm, which is higher than when tolR is not expressed where the peaks are at 17nm, 81nm, and 115nm.Figure 2C: Gel electrophoresis showing TolR (Lane 1, 687bp) inserted into the pET Duet expression plasmid.Again, in combination with the data suggesting the particle count is also increased by g3p expression (Figure 4), there is evidence that g3p is effective at inducing hypervesiculation.Figure 2B: Gel electrophoresis showing g3p inserted into the pRSF Duet expression plasmid (649bp).Positive controls for expression of the pET plasmid are in lanes 2 (non-induced) and 4 (induced).Positive controls for expression of the pRSF plasmid are in lanes 3 (non-induced) and 5 (induced).Lanes 6, 7 and 8 were cut where shown by the red boxes, at the expected sizes for g3p, TolR and INPNC-GFP (7.99kda, 8kda and 60kda, respectively).Therefore, the gel was cut at the expected sizes for g3p, TolR and INPNC-GFP for protein extraction and mass spectrometry analysis.These are shown below:Assembly of g3p, tolR, PP-RFP and INPNC-GFP Expression PlasmidsOur knock-in mutations were achieved by expressing g3p, TolR, PP-RFP, or INPNC-GFP in a T7-promoter driven vector (either pET or pRSF Duet).Interestingly, expression of tolR in the ?tolA strain further doubled the OMV number; while this strongly suggests that tolR greatly boost vesicle count, it should also be tested against the control strain with a lower background OMV count.All in all, then, the data from the NanoSight are consistent with expectations that these strains should hypervesiculate, and thus show our parts work as expected.This SDS PAGE shows some evidence of g3p (7.99kDa) expression, but no evidence for TolR (8kDa) or INPNC-GFP (60kDa) expression.A faint band was observed in lane 6 (NEB T7 + pRSF g3p 1mM IPTG) at the expected size for g3p (7.99kDa).We also showed that inducing expression of g3p increased OMV count, thus showing the part works as expected.To prepare our strains for analysis, we grew them up overnight, leaving 12h 15m for induction, and then harvested OMVs as per our protocol on the experiment page.It is worth noting that these data were collected in one run, with no replicates, as the machine is expensive to run; these data should thus be replicated for stronger conclusions to be drawn.However, to quantify OMV expression it is worth considering not just the number, but the size of these OMVs.", "safety": "To be granted after-hours access to the lab and the equipment, further online training modules were completed including after-hours lab safety and campus safety, as well as general risks in the UNSW school of Biotechnology and Biomolecular sciences.Genetically modify the organism and characterise its ability to create outer membrane vesiclesGenetically modify the organism and characterise its ability to create outer membrane vesiclesTo induce vesicle formation from both the internal and outer membranes.The topics covered in this training included: using equipment in the lab, hazards and risks, safe work procedures, details of emergency procedures and health and safety online training modules including ergonomic training and OHS awareness.Both of these risks have easily manageable solutions such as wearing PPE, sterilisation, labelling items clearly with a chemical hazard data sheet, managing spills with the correct procedures and disposing of waste correctly.If our project is successful it will allow people to use the hypervesiculating strain, for their own uses.We did not actually work with the organism, we merely synthesised one of its genesTo induce vesicle formation from the outer membraneThe risks

with MLC binding sites should function as a glucose inducible promoter (repressing transcription at low glucose concentrations).For our project, we synthesized four variants of the MLC promoter.MLC binds directly to palindromic DNA sequences and blocks RNA polymerase from proceeding with transcription.1,2 In E. coli, MLC is involved in the regulation of many genes involving PTS, including the gene pstG, which encodes for the transmembrane glucose permease also called enzyme IICBGlu (regulation of pstG also involves a CRP, which activates transcription in the presence of glucose: it is thought that the two counter balance one another to provide the correct levels of transcription specifically for enzyme IICBGlu).Recall that enzyme IICB is a transmembrane glucose permease (it is interesting to note that in the presence of glucose IICB sequesters MLC to the plasma membrane, boosting its own transcription).4Sung?Jae Lee et al discovered that when dephosphorylated, the IIB domain of enzyme IICB sequestered MLC to the membrane and that the IIC domain, which is the membrane spanning portion of the protein, is also necessary for the sequestration to occur (see Figure 3).The third promoter in our design is upstream of a yellow chromoprotein.At extremely low concentrations of glucose, the action of the most sensitive promoter dominates, which is our device is always a repressible promoter upstream of a red chromoprotein.The protein MLC has high intracellular concentration when glucose concentration is low and becomes sequestered to the cell membrane when glucose concentrations rise.This caused a reduction in the uptake of glucose, resulting in a decrease in colony size.3 As stated previously, MLC is a repressor involved in the transcription regulation of many proteins involved in PTS, this is why MLC is known as a global repressor.4As stated before, MLC binds to palindromic DNA sequences and blocks transcription, but what stops the action of MLC?Sung?Jae Lee et al, discovered that the active transport of glucose across the cell membrane (into the cell) results in a phosphorylation cascade that causes certain domains of enzyme IICB to bind to the MLC protein and sequester it to the cell membrane.Using the iGEM parts registry, the two promoters selected were BBa_J23112 (weak) and BBa_J23100 (strong) and one MLC binding region was placed either prior or after (post) the promoter (strong and weak refer to the relative frequency to which the promoters actually transcription, with strong being more frequent than weak).This unique tri-color system allows for the quantitative measurement of concentrations because they are associated with visible colors.The third promoter created and was novel promoter to the iGEM parts registry, consisting of MLC binding sites.It has been proposed that mtfA is a peptidase specifically for MLC and helps to increase the transcription of ptsG and other PTS genes.5,6 1) Notley-McRobb L, Death A, Ferenci T. The relationship between external glucose concentration and cAMP levels inside Escherichia coli: implications for models of phosphotransferase-mediated regulation of adenylate cyclase.At extremely low glucose concentrations cAMP levels in the cell are high.Lastly, the third promoter will activate at even higher concentrations resulting in the transcription of a yellow chromoprotein.In our construct, the chromoprotein associated with the second promoter is aeBlue (BBa_K1073021).There was not another glucose inducible promoter in the iGEM regresistry, so our team created a novel promoter.Thus, has the opposite effect as the first; when glucose is low, cAMP levels are high.The sequences for the MLC promoters and the primer are shown below (Figure 2).MLC is a regulatory protein that stands for \u0093Making Large Colonies\u0094, and is encoded by the gene dgsA.In these conditions, cAMP associates with CRP forming a complex that binds to the binding site and activates high levels of transcription.The promoters vary in two characteristics: the strength of the promoter associated with the MLC region and the placement of the MLC region.Characterization of MtfA, a Novel Regulatory Output Signal Protein of the Glucose-Phosphotransferase System in Escherichia coli K-12.The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent glucose\u0096phosphotransferase system from Escherichia coli K-12 as the center of a network regulating carbohydrate flux in the cell.The appropriate BioBrick restriction sites will also be included (prefixes and suffixes so that 3A assembly protocol can be used for the MLC promoters).This third promoter takes advantage of a repressor protein known as MLC, which is discussed below.The first two promoters in our system are already apart of the iGEM registry.The first promoter is part BBa_K118011, submitted to iGEM in 2008 by University of Edinburgh in Scotland.This produces a blue color as the result of transcription of a blue chromoprotein.However, when concentrations increase, the red color diminishes and the second promoter starts becoming activated.Instead of having a CRP binding site upstream of the promoter, the CRP binding site is located within the binding site for DNA polymerase.However, BBa_K118011 only has a lone cAMP receptor protein (CRP) binding site, as opposed to having a CRP binding site and an operator site that binds to the lactose repressor protein.This positive feedback loop results in the vamping up of enzyme IICB on the cell membrane and maximizes the amount of glucose transported into the cell.The mechanism for this promoter can be thought of as the opposite of the first promoter.It has been shown that MLC binds directly to mtfA (originally known as yeeI).5,6 Mutants of mtfA cause a decrease in the expression of ptsG, whereas overexpression causes constitutive expression.\u0093DNA Binding Sites for the MLC and NagC Proteins: Regulation of nagE, Encoding the N-Acetylglucosamine-Specific Transporter inEscherichia Coli.\u0094 Nucleic Acids Research 29.2 (2001): 506\u0096514.This promoter is similar to the familiar promoter for the lactose operon in E. coli cells (the same one as described above).4) Sung?Jae Lee, Winfried Boos, Jean?Pierre Bouch\u00e9, Jacqueline Plumbridge (2000) Signal transduction between a membrane?bound transporter, PtsG, and a soluble transcription factor, MLC, of Escherichia coli.In our construct, downstream of this glucose repressible promoter is efor Red (BBa_K1073023), which contains its own ribosomal binding site (RBS).", "description": "", "design": "", "human_practice": "At Al Stanback Middle School, we spoke to a group of aspiring STEM students about the use of recombinant DNA including how our group was using it.As one of our community outreach projects, we decided to create a short video series demonstrating basic laboratory techniques commonly used by our team this summer.In addition to the education of our peers, we also believe that it is important to educate those of the next generation.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "Ran a 1% gel with the following specifications: 1: 1 kb ladder;

improve the genetic stability of genetically engineered fluorescence proteins as a model for other systems such as therapeutic proteins and metabolic pathways.From these preliminary verbal surveys and interactions with the local community, we found the most common worries people have about synthetic biology is bioterrorism, creating radically new pathogens, DIY biology that can be used by anyone for harm, and toxins in GMOs that are unsafe.Over the course of the weekend, we created an interactive synthetic biology booth called \"Painting with E. coli\", where participants can use various fluorescent E. coli to \"paint\" on agar plates.Our lab members spent time talking with each participants to gain an understanding of current opinions on synthetic biology and GMO s, while also trying to correct common misunderstandings and highlight the benefits of the uses of this field.By addressing and solving the issue of stability we can deploy synthetic biology for the betterment of society and the future of science.One of the main concerns for the exponentially growing field of synthetic biology is bridging the gap between science and society.When it comes to fixing Third World problems such as access to fuels, food, water, or materials in a cost effective and timely manner, stable genetic devices within engineered microorganisms could be the answer.For instance, advances in synthetic biology can lead to technologies such as bacterial photography, tumor-targeting bacteria, and biofuels (Sleight, 2010).While synthetic biology offers one possible solution, its viability is hindered as a result of genetic instability.However, in order for a genetically enhanced organism to perform its desired function reliably, the installed genes must persist through numerous generations.Companies such as this invest millions on genetic devises to make their products, therefore if these genetic devices are unstable then the company will lose a lot of money.For example, Amyris, a company specializing in synthetic biology products, spent $33,202,000 in 2014 to make their biosynthetic models (Amyris 2014).A village in a country without stable power will not have the ability to simply thaw out another tube of bacteria, should their device-containing bacteria mutate to break the device.Since the evolutionary process continues even after an organism is genetically engineered to produce biofuel precursors, the genetic device is at risk.From a personal perspective, we have encountered peers at the University that are not entirely well-versed on the benefits of this technology, but slowly iGEM at the University of Texas at Austin is making a bigger contribution in educating our peers and reaching out to the entire community.By learning more about genetic stability, we can develop ways to increase it in the devices we design in the future.Fluorescent bacteria in the colors red, cyan, blue, yellow, and green were prepared in our lab using BioBrick parts.Plates decorated by participants at SXSW CreateAt this year s 2015 SXSW Create, we decided to help our local community better understand what synthetic biology is all about, while also promoting

a few genes, which regulates the start of Coliclock system.cl repressor targets pLux/cl promoters in the cell \u0096 and we used this kind of promoter with all the other Coliclock system genes.Cas3 protein binds to the single stranded DNA and cleaves it.We use this bacterial protection CRISPR-Cas system to create a method by which we could programme the life of genetically modified bacteria.This unit is essential for system regulation.Once the functional subunit is switched on and the transcription of functional subunit genes is present, Cascade, together with the crRNA molecules, forms a big ribonucleoprotein complex, which targets DNA polymerase III and RNA polymerase genes.As mentioned before, cl is a repressor of pLux/cI promoter, that is why all the genes, which have this specific promoter, are repressed from transcription.Regulatory unit will suppress Coliclock system while you are still working with the bacteria in the laboratory and will make a start once the cells are set free.Theoretically, any other specific promoter can be used in this system, which, in turn, will be adjusted according to the promoter properties.We chose pLac, because it is widely used and we wanted to make sure that our system works.When the cells are released into their natural habitat, there is no IPTG inductor, therefore, the synthesis of cl repressor stops.To deal with contaminations, to fertilize plants or help to deal with lack of nitrogen for the periods it is necessary for crops \u0096 this is what bacteria in a coat of GMOs could be used for.In the environment IPTG does not occur, so repressor cI is not synthesized - Cd and Cas are transcribed.This is the point at which our system switches from laboratory mode into wildlife mode.This creates a positive loop of expression \u0096 the first transcribed proteins join into a complex, which activates the further transcription of the same proteins.One of the main goals of our project is regulating a specific number of life cycles that genetically altered bacteria could go through, when it is released into natural wildlife conditions.Throughout the project we used the knowledge of cloning and the function of genes from a number of different organisms.Cas3 is a single-stranded DNA nuclease and ATP-dependent helicase in the CRISPR/Cas immune system.The concentration of the repressor is just enough for the cell to divide a few more times while all the promoters of functional subunit of the system are still repressed.In the lab repressor cI is synthesized, because of presence of IPTG, and pLux/cI promoter is repressed - Cd and Cas3 are not transcribed.The Coliclock allows new applications of GMOs and expands the locations where GM bacteria could be used safely.The main celebrity of our project is CRISPR-Cas system.CRISPR-Cas system is quite common between bacteria and archaea, where it is widely used for protection from foreign nucleic acid (DNA or RNA).pLac promoter is located within regulatory unit genes of our system.According to these RBS sequences, the expression of CRISPR-Cas genes either is stronger or weaker, which reflects on bacterial lifetime: the stronger RBS sequence, the bigger CRISPR gene expression, the shorter bacterial lifetime.After a specific times of divisions, cl repressor concentration reaches the point where it can not target all the pLux/cl promoters anymore.In our project, we aimed to regulate the amount of cell divisions that a cell can make, in other words, we wanted to control the start of a functional system unit.Regulatory unit was cloned from Standart Assembly Biobricks, sent from iGEM Headquarters, while functional units were cloned from A. actinomycetemcomitans by amplifying the desired genes by using PCR.Gasiunas G, Sinkunas T, Siksnys V (2014) Molecular mechanisms of CRISPR-mediated microbial immunity.Our Coliclock system is the key that will unlock these laboratory doors.We call this whole construct the \"switch-on\" of the functional Coliclock system subunit.Figure 4.Positive loop occurs, when LuxR and LuxI interacts with each other and increase transcription of itselves.The product of LuxI sequence is HL (homoserine lactone, which, together with the LuxR protein, acts as an activation complex for pLux/cl promoters.They are essential for the survival of bacteria.There are three main components in CRISPR-Cas system: Cascade complex, cas3 protein and homogenic CRISPR region that codes crRNA molecules.System function differences, when bacteria are in the lab (above) and when in the environment (below).This is Coliclock \u0096 an automatic timer, which starts when you set the bacteria free to do its function.What is more \u0096 you do not have to worry that this newly constructed bacteria will compete with regular wildtype bacteria and therefore create ecological and/or ethical problems.We built up our project with the goal to limit the prevalence of GMOs (genetically modified organisms) in nature.Coliclock bacteria, once its function is over, will die.Our method can be divided into two main parts: functional unit and regulatory unit.Those genes are later cleaved by the cas3 nuclease.We used I-F type CRISPR-Cas system, which is naturally found in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans bacterial cultures.It does not depend on the environment \u0096 it only depends on how you prepare your GMOs in laboratory before using them outside the lab.A functional unit, on the other hand, consists of all the three CRISPR-Cas system components.Coliclock is a unique bacterial security system, which has never been done before.Why?At first it is not very indicative, but through the positive loop expression increases dramatically.This system not only ensures to stop the spread of GM bacteria to environment, but it also guarantees the suicide mechanism for a bacterium.Once the concentration of cI repressor reaches a minor treshold, the transcription of LuxR and LuxI begins.Also Cascade (Cd), Cas3 and crRNA are in this regulatory unit.", "design": "CRISPR regions were synthesized by gene synthesis, while Cascade and cas3 proteins were cloned in our laboratory earlier.In wild type CRISPR-Cas system proteins we found restriction sites, that are recognized by the restriction enzymes used in Standart Assembly.This is our regulatory unit, which, in fact, has all the necessary elements to function and control Coliclock system.Firstly, we synthesized pLuxI/cI promoter sequences, togerther with different RBS sequences: strong (Bba_B0030), medium (Bba_0032) and weak (Bba_0030).There is no more EcoRI restriction site, so restriction enzyme should not have any effect on Cascade protein.After that, our team performed PCR reactions, during which we added prefix and suffix sequences to our genes.We changed one nucleotide in that way, that the amino acid, which is coded in the triplet, would not change, however, the restriction site would be damaged.Cas3 gene had 3 different restriction sites of our interest \u0096 EcoRI, XbaI and PstI.All in all, we got CRISPR-Cas system genes, which have different expression pattern.We performed Quick change gene mutagenesis with the Invitrogen Multi site mutagenesis Plus kit.For that reason restrictase would not be able to recognize the site and the middle of the gene would not be cut, when cloning via standart assembly.Cas3 is a single-stranded DNA nuclease and ATP-dependent helicase in the CRISPR/Cas immune system.Cascade complex had only one restriction site \u0096 EcoRI.Functional unit, as mentioned before, consists of three main constructs: Cascade complex, cas3 protein and homogenic CRISPR region.We amplified this promoter sequence with the help of polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Overlapping oligonucleotides were synthesized to the full constructs during PCR.We also cloned pLux/cI promoters (along with different RBS sequences) into these genes.By regulating the expression of functional unit we will control the lifetime of Coliclock.Gasiunas G, Sinkunas T, Siksnys V (2014) Molecular mechanisms of CRISPR-mediated microbial immunity.", "human_practice": "There are some opinions and fears, associated with synthetic biology and GMOs, but also we observed that audience knew some serious advantages of this scientific area.Our team especially liked one comment from the audience, that one hundred years ago people were exceptionally afraid of radio waves.We are really happy to make an impact on synthetic biology community development here, in Lithuania!Our team educated society during various events, as we described.This meeting was dedicated to share some insights from society, offer some suggestions for the new amendment for the law of GMOs control in Lithuania and make a partnership between Vilnius iGEM team and the Ministry of Environment.In Lithuania, the law for the GMO control was released in 2002 and it has only been changed once in 2006.Now our government is going to re-new this law.Therefore we analyzed the existing one and arranged a meeting with a department of environmental protection at the Ministry of Environment.We are invited to participate in this meeting and we are asked to prepare a speech about our project: the biotechnology and iGEM as well.On September the 3rd our team had an opportunity to talk about synthetic biology and present iGEM in a popular event, called Caf\u00e9 Scientifique.This is a discussion-like event, in which we got a chance to participate, present our topic and iGEM competition and hear opinions of people from various fields.Our team member Ingrida presented what is synthetic biology and iGEM competition.Together with the audience we discussed pros and cons of synthetic biology and GMOs.On 5th-6th of November there will be meeting of Baltic Countries held by this ministry to introduce the development and achievements of Lithuania in a field of environment.We are really happy for this prospectively long-lasting co-operation with Ministry of Environment and we want to thank them for taking care of lithuanians, their education and development of science.On our proposal we agreed that there must be some place for education in synthetic biology technologies between all these documents.In that case, a department mentioned above, wants to draw an attention to synthetic biology.Therefore, as our (Vilnius iGEM team) and Ministry s of Environment missions overlap, we will definately continue this partnership.People agreed that a dialogue between scientists and society is essential, when we are talking about biotechnology.We hope that this discussion will contribute to people s understanding about biosciences, synthetic biology and genetical engineering.This department prepares proposal for the changes in the law and we agreed on further co-operation.", "modeling": "In the environment there is no IPTG, so bacteria survival depends on RBS strength.Concentration of Cas3 and Cascade (Cd in the model) depends on these different RBS sites.Concentration of Cas3 and Cascade (Cd in the model) depends on these different RBS sites.IPTG is not found in an environment, so that is why it is the main regulator.In the environmet cI expression is reduced, because there is no IPTG here.The second unit is functional, which does all the work to kill bacteria.There are a few essential structures in the model, which are general for both moduls \u0096 laboratory and environment.Relation between Cas3 concentrations (X1, X2 and X3) can be defined as an inequality:How everything would work in the environment?If RBS is weak, smaller concentrations of Cas3 and Cd (X1 and Y1 respectively in the model) occurs.First of all, regulatory unit is resposible for system regulation and inductor IPTG is

model, number of bacteria in the laboratory is labeled as Z0.With medium RBS, Cas3 \u0096 X2 and Cd \u0096 Y2.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "According to this data, we can say, that our Cascade complex biobrick (BBa_K1773022) is expressed and actively functions in degradation of cell DNA.We wanted to make a contribution to the ever growing iGEM parts registry by characterizing one of more frequently used promoters, that is called the standard (lambda cI regulated) promoter, biobrick code \u0096 BBa_R1051.To do this we employed a complex system that relies on GFP expression as a measurable identity that lets us to quantify levels of transcription from the cI regulated promoter.These genes were cloned from a paradantosis causing bacterium Aggregatibacter actinomycetem\u00adcomitans (try to say it out loud) DS-7 strain.In order to make them biobrick compatible, we had to do several quick change mutagenesis reactions, because the wild type gene consisted of several restriction sites used by Standart Assembly restriction enzymes: 3 for the Cas3 gene and 1 for Cascade complex gene.The wild type plasmid of Cascade complex was in a pCDF-Duet vector and had one EcoRI restriction site inside the Cascade complex gene.The unit consists of a gene for the Cas3 protein, genes for the Cascade complex, and a homogenous crRNA region for the Cascade complex.Using custom gene synthesis, we synthesised two homogenous CRISPR regions, which had 6 identical spacers surrounded by repeat sequences.The proteins generated from these plasmids form the Cascade complex, which is then detected with Western blot.Our experiment was a success, and we have obtained an expression of our Cascade constructs, compared to the negative controls, wich had no plasmids (Figure 3).After six mutant plasmid digestion with EcoRI, no DNA linearization was present, compared to the non-mutated Cascade control (K).The Cas3 gene was in a pET-Duet vector and had EcoRI, XbaI and PstI restriction sites upstream the gene (in the vector multi-cloning site area) and in the gene itself.In theory, our regulatory unit upon induction with IPTG should produce cI repressor, which, in turn, should downregulate the expression of the GFP gene (under the control of cI regulated promoter).Experiment was conducted in two conditions\u00a0: without IPTG and with 2.5 mM IPTG present.However, when IPTG is present, we can see a dramatic cell count drop of almost 100x in bacteria, harbouring our crRNA s (SP1 and SP2), compared to the control (K).We wanted to see a different protein expression between the biobrick, which had a strong RBS (S), medium RBS (M) or weak RBS (W), however, the western blot did not show any differences.So we emplyed a regulatory unit - BBa_K077039 which is composed of pLac promoter sequence (BBa_R0010), which allows the induction of transcription by addition of IPTG, followed by cI coding gene (BBa_P0151, the biobrick also included the necessary RBS and terminator sequences).For the fluorescence measurement experiments we took advantage of protocol that was provided by the iGEM headquarters for the InterLab Measurement experiment.With these three components present in a bacteria and when IPTG is present in the medium (pColaDuet vector harbouring Cas3 needs IPTG for expression), the killing mechanism turns on.However, our created biobrick parts does not have a His6 sequence, because we did not want to make alterations to the proteins themselves, because they might loose their function.Instead, we co-expressed our biobrick parts with a plasmid, coding one of the proteins of the Cascade complex (Csy3) with a His6 sequence in E.coli BL21-DE3 strain.The wild type (WT) Cas3 protein was in a pETDuet vector and had EcoRI (E), XbaI (X) and PstI (P) restriction sites upstream of the Cas3 gene, and in the middle of Cas3 gene, all in close proximity.The wild type gene was in a pCDF vector and had one EcoRI restriction site in the gene of Cascade complex.In order to achieve this, we cloned the cI regulated promoter in front of the GFP gene (BBa_I13504, the biobrick already contained appropriate RBS and terminator sequences.Though we saw that GFP expression from the cI regulated promoter is strong.After restriction analysis of mutated Cascade plasmids (Figure 1) we can see, that the wild type (WT) Cascade plasmid was linearized by EcoRI, but the six mutated plasmids have retained superspiralized form, and were not cleaved by the enzyme.Figure 1.SP1 targets E.coli DNA polymerase III ? subunit (DEG10190064), and SP2 targets RNA polymerase ? subunit (DEG10190205).For tunable protein expression we constructed three biobricks for Cas3, with strong RBS site (BBa_K1773019), medium RBS site (BBa_K1773020) and weak RBS site (BBa_K1773021), and every construct had a pLux/cI right promoter for controlled expression.Each CRISPR region encode crRNA, which, assembled into the Cascade complex, targets an essential gene of the E. coli cell.It can be seen that upon induction of cI expression there is a significant drop in relative fluorescence, the general tendency is that d fluorescence signal depletes with increasing concentrations of IPTG, however we see great variation in our data.We prepared BL21-DE3 strain\u00a0E. coli\u00a0cells with our Cascade expression construct, along with a complement plasmid, carrying the Cas3 gene in a pCola-Duet vector.The whole experiment performed in order to transform the third plasmid, harbouring the crRNA region, into these bacteria.Restriction was compared to the unmutated non-digested wild type Cas3 plasmid (K).After a few tries we successfully made all mutagenesis reactions of both Cas3 and Cascade genes, confirming them with restriction analysis and sequencing.The expressed Cascade proteins assemble into a complex with the synthesized crRNA molecules, and binds to either the DNA pol.We suggest that this unpredictability might be due to the low translation levels of cI protein (weak RBS) combined with its instability (LVA tail) and its nature of a dominant repressor.We did not find any biobricks from the I-type CRISPR-Cas systems in the parts registry, so we are the first!We acquired the cloned genes of the main proteins of the I-F type CRISPR-Cas system, which function in the interference stage (DNA destruction).This may have to do with experimental error or in this exact construct, the strong RBS is expressed weaker than the other two.We planned an experiment, during which we can see our system s killing profficiency.This part was also sequenced and shipped to the parts registry.For our project to be feasible and working, our new synthesised CRISPR-Cas biobrick parts had to be expressed in the cell.We differentiated them into a few main parts and documented all the information depending on the purpose of the lab goals.As we are a new team on iGEM, we wanted to bring something new to the competition as well, so we constructed two novel CRISPR-Cas biobricks, belonging to the I-F type CRISPR-Cas system.All parts were sequenced and shipped to iGEM Headquarters for future uses!In addition, we almost finished to fully assemble our regulatory unit, which would regulate and turn on the functional unit when the cells are released into the environment.After restriction analysis of a non-mutated Cas3 gene, two bands are visible (Figure 2).We suggest that BBa_K195613 is indeed sensitive to cI and the effects of cI on transcription levels from this promoter are somewhat titratable, however we claim that this system (BBa_K077039 + BBa_K195613) is highly unpredictable.After counting bacterial CFU\u0092s (colony forming units) (Figure 3), we estimated, that under conditions with no IPTG present all cells showed similar bacterial count with our control (K), which had no crRNA region.We also wanted to characterize the ability of the promoter to be repressed by producing the cI protein in vivo.M \u0096 molecular mass marker (Spectra broad range protein protein ladder); K \u0096 possitive control of Csy3 protein; Cascade biobricks were expressed within strong (S), medium (M) or weak (W) RBS sites.These effects combined might lead to an effect in which changes in a small population of repressor might have great effects on the whole system.This may be due to the fact, that expression was too big to see subtile differences.BL \u0096 BL21-DE3 strain with no transformed plasmids.Another interesting result is that Cascade with strong RBS was expressed weaker than with a medium or weak RBS site.We managed to make an intermediate part consisting of pLac inducible cI lambda repressor attached to a LuxI gene, under a pLux/cI right promoter (BBa_K1773026).", "safety": "Or will the team create a laboratory system, which could be used by other scientists?Our project is applicable for the second option.Coliclock is a system, which can be

Marion, our bioinformatician.To explain our project to a wider public, we made a video which was released together with the campaign.Claire was the mediator who got us the financial support from the Office for Science & Technology at the Embassy of France in the United States.Also, as a financial strategy our team also got involved into a crowdfunding campaign.Our goal was to raise awareness about Synthetic Biology, collect opinions about it and talk about the iGEM competition with a non scientific audience.Fabrice Leclerc, Claire Toffano-Nioche, Emily Drouineau and Matthieu Sarazin helped a lot and gave very important feedback for this aspect of the project.The Design of our Wiki was done by Gaetan and Carla with the help of Maxime Schaffhauser, a web writer student and it has been programmed by Fabio.The lecturers were Pierre Walrafen, an European Patent Attorney, and Jean Denis Faure, a researcher and professor at AgroParisTech school.With the help of Stella Pacheco from the CROUS of Versailles, the TEAM held an exhibition at Nanterre University called \"This is not a Lemon\".The video equipment was provided by Martin and filmed by him.Without our sharp lab team, our project would have never seen the light of the day.A moment which allowed great interaction with other parisian teams and their projects, specially during the \"ice breakers\" picnics.Marin and Carla went with their camera to the Luxembourg s garden in Paris to interview parisians and know more their opinion about synthetic biology.The main purpose of this meeting was several to exchange informations concerning the guideline of the project, more precisely: to discuss about a reporter system (visualisation tool) and which area we should target (for instance: ter site or replichores right).Dr.The teammates working during the months of June, July and August were: Laetitia, Naiane, Mathilde, Caroline, Marion, L\u00e9a, Charl\u00e8ne, Terrence and Alice.She is working on a report for the French Parliament on economical and environnemental issues of new biotechnologies, especially CRISPR-Cas9.Dr Agn\u00e8s Ricroch: Professor at AgroParisTech school working on plants and their regulations.Pr Marc Fellous: Emeritus Professor at Paris Diderot University and Medical DoctorMr Eric Enderlin: French and European Patent Attorney at Novagraaf.Video summary of the Conference about The Societal Issues of CRISPR/Cas9We organized a conference in Paris-Sud University about the societal issues of CRISPR-Cas9.*This wiki was conceived during long nights of work and a great coffee experience in the beautiful Orsay, France.Olivier Esp\u00e9li, a reseacher and an expert in Genome Dynamics studies at the Coll\u00e8ge-de-France, accepted to receive Victor, Manhaz, Marion and Philippe.Naiane was the one who took care of the organization and communication along with Pasteur Paris teams members.Furthermore, the instructors (Claire, Marie and Olivier) and the PIs (Philippe and Sylvie) have guided the team during all the lab work.Some of us, Caroline, Marion, Alice and Claire were present at the site to meet people and answer their questions.It took place on the 6th of August in Pasteur Paris Institute.Furthermore, Marion and Terrence, who have the best skills in IT, gave a strong support on the Wiki design development.For the visualization part, Caroline, Charl\u00e8ne and L\u00e9a made all the bibliographic research and designed the biobricks.A great way to spend a summer day under the parisian sun.Here is listed all the events and the team members who participated to them.", "background": "These genes associations could not only be significant for protein-protein interactions after translation but could also be significant to enhance or to inhibit transcription initiation.To understand transcriptional regulation, we have to study chromosome topology in 4-dimensions (3D + time) and its effect on the recruitment of DNA binding proteins.The binding of a multisubunit RNA polymerase or general transcription factors to a specialized transcription promoter DNA sequence is an essential step in initiating DNA transcription in all organisms (Friedman 2013).Numerous molecules and factors are involved in the mechanism of transcription and can be involved in its regulation.Transcription of the DNA template into a RNA moleculeBut other factors can be necessary to begin transcription or to prevent it, especially when the promoter is not strong enough to keep the ?-factor attached to it.Moreover, the products of the A and B operons are produced in close proximity, favouring their interaction.\u00bbIn the same way a single sigma factor, specific of a group of genes, could be recruited from a promoter to another easily because of the DNA topology.Binding of RNA polymerase on a promoter, a specific sequence on the DNA.3b]; intersegment transfer, when the protein binds two different segments of DNA before releasing one; and looping, which consists on the binding of two DNA segments leading to a loop (Bustamante 1999, Bondos 2015) [Fig.Considering this gap in knowledge, new studies have to be conducted without a priori in order to determine if fine tuning of the DNA topology takes place during transcriptional regulation and if so, how does such regulation work.Transcriptional regulation can occur at every step on the pathway to gene expression, but transcription initiation is probably the most frequently regulated step (Haugen 2008).For example, the number of genes in Escherichia coli is about 5 000 and the number of active RNA polymerases is about 200 per cell, of which 140 only transcribe 2% of the genes leaving 60 polymerases for the other 4995 genes.Thus, there is tight competition between genes to get transcribed: competition between the same ?-factor for several promoters, competition between ?-factors for the rest of the RNA polymerase or competition between a ?-factor and other DNA binding proteins.Recent observations lead to the idea that genes, not in the same operon but spatially close, are highly co-transcribed, even in the absence of regulatory factors at their promoter regions.The iGEM Paris-Saclay project aims at studying the effects of DNA topology on gene expression in E. coli by answering this question:Does bringing two differentialy regulated promoters close to each others influences the expression level of genes located downstream?We have designed a new tool based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system to bring two specific DNA regions closer.3].This is why the link between genome topology and gene regulation is a major research topic in the subject of transcription.Indeed, products of gene-coding-protein are synthesized near their gene and a pairing of genes can results in an increasing probability for the two proteins to interact with each others [Fig.6] (Dorman 2013).Figure 6\u00a0: Nucleoid folding and gene regulation, From Dorman 2013.\u00ab\u00a0A simple regulon consisting of a regulatory gene and two structural operons, A and B, is illustrated in various conformations.Moreover one ?-factor can lead to the beginning of transcription of a gene, be released and lead to the beginning of the transcription of an other one.The gene pair density is indicated by increasing dot size.\u00bb Because of this periodicity, regulation could be effective in particular area of the chromosome, leading to a fine, but integral, tuning of the genes involved in the same pathway.Although the mechanisms of global gene regulation by changes in DNA organization are well established, the fine tuning of transcription is particularly hard to study and not very well understood.Release of the ?-factor and elongationAs mentioned above, DNA topology plays a fundamental role in gene regulation and in protein interactions after their synthesis.It is the process in which an RNA molecule is created based on the sequence of a DNA template.Each dCas9 will target a specific DNA sequence, one on the chromosome and one on a plasmid, whereas the dimerization system will promote the joining of the two dCas9s when rapalog is added.In order to assess whether or not this system works, we have also designed a new tool to visualize the interaction between both dCas9s.It is the result of: The recruitment of the other parts of the RNA polymerase; The formation of an open complex, thus the unwinding of DNA from either side of the promoter; The release of the ?-factor (Browning 2002) [Fig.RNA polymerase is the protein that performs transcription by binding to promoters before starting transcription.Conversely, a strong promoter could have a better chance of recruiting a ?-factor leading to \u0093starving\u0094 of the weaker promoters within the same area.The sigma factor is released and binds an other close promoter on a pair gene, allowing the formation of an active RNA polymerase.Transcription factors are proteins that enhance or prevent transcription; other factors such as small molecules, DNA sequence properties, and chromosome structure also play a role even though these mechanisms are diverse and often poorly understood (Browning 2002) [Fig.In this case the template is a gene, a region of DNA whose RNAs can be translated into proteins, which perform different functions within the cell.That s why concepts such as regulons (genes that are usually geographically scattered but under the control of the same regulatory factor), who were initially described with a 2D vision of the bacterial chromosomes, could be specified with the incorporation of new researches.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 109, E42\u0096E50.Travers, A., and Muskhelishvili, G. (2005).Some proteins bind DNA with the same affinity regardless of the DNA sequence, others can only be recruited by specific sequences.4].The first step, in which the ?-factor binds to the promoter, can limit the transcription rate.Gene order and chromosome dynamics coordinate spatiotemporal gene expression during the bacterial growth cycle.Binding of a sigma factor on gene A s promoter.However, when the chromosome is reorganized as a solenoid (left) or as a plectoneme (right), the periodicity of these structures brings the three genes close together, between the regulatory gene and its two target operons.Recruitment of RNA polymerase subunits on the ?-factor.d. Looping of DNA allowed by a DNA binding protein These four mechanisms allow for dynamic binding of proteins to their target sequences, despite the fact that these proteins are not present in large concentrations.Promoters in the environment: transcriptional regulation in its natural context.Among these, only the one-dimensional sliding is independent of spatial organization in the chromosome, that\u0092s why the structural organization of genomes is very important for transcriptional regulation.Figure 3\u00a0: Four mechanisms allow DNA-binding proteins to find target sequences.a.The dimensions of the helices are 2.5 \u00b5m high with a radius of 0.3 \u00b5m, compatible with an average E. coli cell.These competitions are fundamental in the mechanism of transcriptional regulation.When the chromosome is represented in a one?dimensional, linear form, the three genetic loci are separated by large distances in space.c. Intersegment transfer of two DNA binding proteins (dark blue circles) linked by another protein (blue circle) from a DNA segment to an other.Transcription factors (blue circles) can inhibit or enhance transcription rate.These DNA binding proteins are able to bind to DNA with different strengths also called affinities.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 110, 9740\u00969745.Haugen, S.P., Ross, W., and Gourse, R.L.Recruitment of the other parts of the RNA polymerase (red and yellow) on the sigma factor.In bacteria, it is one of these subunits that binds first to the promoter.Theories behind these concepts focused on protein-protein interactions after translation, which occurs at the same time as transcription in bacteria.d. Termination of gene A s transcription, an entire RNA molecule is released.Thus, gene pair associations could provide the cell with another level of regulation of transcription.They are often allowed or prevented by remodeling of the chromosome topology (Haugen 2008) [Fig.Stochastic Gene Expression in a Single Cell.Beginning of gene B s transcription, producing a RNA (dark green) molecule.This system is composed of two different dCas9s fused with each part of the FRB / FKBP12 dimerization system.Binding of a ?-factor on a promoter.A part of adaptation consists in using different proteins present at different times in the cell.c. Gene A s transcription begins, producing a RNA (orange) molecule.RNA polymerase approaches its promoter without long-range sliding along DNA.Nature Reviews Microbiology 3, 157\u0096169.Wright, M.A., Kharchenko, P., Church, G.M., and Segr\u00e8, D. (2007).Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 104, 10559\u009610564.These two small GFP tags will interact with the complementary GFP detector only if the two dCas9s are close enough to interact.Transcription is the first step of the Central dogma of molecular biology.A strong promoter could recruit a ?-factor and after its release, this ?-factor would have a better probability of being recruited to a weaker promoter.Four mechanisms by which a DNA binding protein finds its target sequence are known: sliding, when the protein slides along DNA [Fig.As a result, we think that spatially close promoters can act on each others, for example by doubling the number of sequences which can recruit a ?-factor in a certain area.Such structures could be selected to keep gene pairs close to each other.These changes can be the result of transcriptional regulations.Sequences called promoters are small DNA sequences upstream of genes.Nature Reviews Microbiology 6, 507\u0096519.Ishihama, A.", "description": "To achieve this goal, we constructed two new biobricks: one composed of a sequence encoding FRB* linked to GFP11 and one composed of a sequence encoding FKBP12 linked to GFP10.The following gBlocks were designed to be assembled with the GFP10 and GFP11 parts as it is illustrated in the strategy page of our wiki (Table 1).Table 1: gBlocks used for the characterization of Tripartite GFP and FRB*/FKBP12 system.We decided to order gBlocks of optimized FRB* and FKBP sequence instead of optimizing the FRB and FKBP coding sequences we got from Takara Clontech ( * shows the optimization that we perform on FRB sequence to be more adaptable to bacteria system).We found out that the 3\u0092 end of the gene encoding dCas9 Td did not match the expected sequence.Due to a lack of time, we decided to put aside the BDC tool construction to focus on constructing the visualization tool as it was mandatory to have it first in order to use it to validate our BDC tool.For this sub-project, we ordered gBlocks thanks to IDT\u0092s offer, and according to our design.To build this tool, dCas9 S. p and dCas9 T. d) were ordered from addgene.org, and the genes encoding the optimized FRB and FKBP12 were obtained by ordering gBlocks from IDT [Table 1].As plasmids we received from addgene.orgwere already transformed into the bacteria, we prepared the overnight culture of received bacteria in order to extract the plasmid coding for dCas9.This one suppresses amber codon allowing the translation of the green fusion chromoprotein.In order to characterize the biobrick, the color switch system (BBa_K13372001) was tested on three different constructions, contained in the plasmid pcl99: TAA: LacZ and Luc coding sequences in the same open reading frame, separated with an ochre stop codon.To sum-up, we were able to construct the biobrick containing the dCas9 ST linked to GFP11 (but with two missing nucleotides) and also the biobrick containing coding sequence for the third part of tripartite GFP (GFP 1-9) but only in the pUC19 plasmid.The sequence was as expected except for the joining of gblocks 3.1-3.2 and 4.1-4.2 where one nucleotide was missing.Concerning the sequence encoding the dcas9 ST linked to GFP11, the ligation between the gBlocks 2.1 and 2.2 did not seem to work as we could not amplify fragment 2 by doing a PCR on the ligation product of fragments 2.1 with 2.2.Finally, the system can by well-constructed and expressed but we may not have found the optimal conditions to induce the dimerization (concentration of rapalog, timing, temperature).In order to characterize our visualization tool, we designed a plasmid (pZA11) in which there are two target sites for dCas9 proteins fused with GFP parts.However, due to a lack of time, we could not achieve the final construction of our plasmid (pZA11) by Gibson assembly method.The BDC tool construct is composed of the dCas9 S. p linked to FRB* and the dCas9 T. d linked to FKBP12 (for further details, check our Design page.This codon is not recognized by the supD suppressor t-RNA\u00a0: no luciferase activity is expected.pcl_Tq construction does not contain any stop codon\u00a0: the luciferase activity is expected to be at the maximal.pcl_TAG contains the TAG codon recognized by supD suppressor t-RNA\u00a0: the expression of luciferase should be inducible by salicylate.Results showed that fragments with the correct size were obtained.Thanks to an overlap between the two fragments (1 and 2, 3 and 4), an overlap between the prefix present at the beginning of fragment 1 and 3 and pSB1C3, and an overlap between the suffix present at the end of fragment 2 and 4 and pSB1C3, we were able to assemble them in pSB1C3 using the Gibson Assembly method.We conclude that supD suppressor tRNA is very specific of the TAG codon and has no impact on the TAA stop codon.Figure 15: Luciferase activity with TAG construction depending of salicylate concentration.Figure 3: Map of the plasmid pSB1C3 coding for FKBP-GFP10 and FRB-GFP11To characterize our system, we tested the expression and integrity of the three protein compounds of the system with western blot.Luciferase activity depends on the expression and capacity of the suppressor t-RNA to read TAG codon.In TAG condition we can see an increase of stop codon readthrough activity with the increase of the salicylate concentration [Fig.Visualization tool is composed of three main parts: the biobrick containing dCas9 NM linked to GFP10 coding sequences, the biobrick containing dCas9 ST linked to GFP11 coding sequences, and the biobrick containing the GFP 1-9 coding sequence.This fragment was obtained for colonies 6 and 8.Figure 9: Migration of colony PCR products obtained from bacteria transformed with the Gibson Assembly of Fragments 3 and 4 in pSB1C3.pcl_TAG contains the TAG codon recognized by supD suppressor t-RNA.The luciferase luminescence is expected to vary depending to the different constructions conditions and to salicylate concentrations, instead of the Beta Galactosidase activity, which will remain constant.Conversely, the down regulation of the suppressor tRNA in absence of salicylate will allow bacteria switch from green to yellow, thus simulating the ripening of a real lemon.Luciferase activity depends on the transcription of pclTAA.The Tq plasmid does not contain any stop codon between LacZ and Luc.Consequently, we did not get a full construct of our visualization tool and thus we were not able to test it.As a part of the characterization of a previous existing Biobrick Part, we have chosen the BBa_K13372001 biobrick from the Paris-Saclay 2014 project This is not a lemon.Finally, the third GFP subunit (1 \u0096 9) biobrick is only composed of the gBlock GFP 1-9.The first step was to check gBlocks, because according to IDT, 80% of the gBlocks have the correct ordered sequence.Gibson Assembly products are then transformed into bacteria, and a colony PCR was performed using primers complementary to the suffix and prefix sequences to screen positive bacteria colonies.Clones 2 and 5 are positive.Assembling the gBlocks to get the desired biobricksWhen sequences were as expected, the same plasmidic DNA extraction products were used to perform high fidelity PCRs, using primers which hybridized at both extremities of the gBlock.But GFP10 and GFP11 are negative.We transformed E.coli with pSB1C3 coding for FKBP-GFP10 and FRB-GFP11 and pUC19 coding for the third part of GFP as we could not clone GFP1.9 in pSB1C3.TAG: LacZ and Luc coding sequences in the same open reading frame, separated with an amber stop codon.Each condition was tested under three different salicylate concentrations.In presence of high salicylate concentration in the agar media, supD will be expressed and so the green fusion chromoprotein: bacteria will display a green color.Therefore, the suppressor tRNA will suppress amber codon allowing the translation of the green fusion chromoprotein in presence of salicylate.Luciferase activity depends on the expression and capacity of the suppressor t-RNA to read TAA codon.In TAA condition, regardless of the salicylate concentration, there is no significant Luciferase activity, so the ratio remains very low at any concentrations [Fig.The decrease of salicylate concentration causes a lost of suppressor tRNA and so on the fall of blue chromoprotein expression\u00a0: bacteria changes from green to yellow.The tRNA used is the supD suppressor tRNA.2]).Figure 1: Map of the plasmid pSB1C3 coding for FRB fused with GFP11 Figure 2: Map of the plasmid pSB1C3 coding for FKBP fused with GFP10We then assembled both plasmids together and constructed the plasmid coding for FKBP-GFP10 and FRB-GFP11 as shown in [fig.Table 2: List and size of gBlocks ordered to build the characterization plasmid and the sgRNA expression system.We successfully inserted all the gBlocks into intermediate plasmids.However, according to the results of PCRs on the extracted plasmids, we could not amplify the coding gene of the dCas9s.These two fragments are themselves respectively composed by the ligation of gBlocks 1.1 and 1.2, and gBlocks 2.1 and 2.2.The third part of the tripartite GFP (GFP1-9) was obtained in the pUC19 plasmid with the expected sequence but its cloning into the pSB1C3 plasmid by digestion/ligation was unsuccessful.As we were afraid the monoclonal antibody recognized only one subunit of the tripartite GFP which was GFP1.9.7] shows the results of this screening for the assembly of fragments 3 and 4 in pSB1C3.The expected product was around 4000 bp and it was found at the expected size for clones 6 and 8.Therefore, plasmids were extracted from the cultures of colonies 6 and 8, and were then stocked and sent for sequencing.When the gBlocks have been validated, they were ready for further manipulation such as Gibson assembly or digestion and ligation techniques to construct our final design.The following gBlocks were designed to construct our Visualization tool [Table 3]:Table 3: gBlocks used to build the visualisation toolFigure 6: Scheme of the visualization tool design.In conclusion, the Psal promoter is fully inducible by salicylate and the suppressor tRNA is functional to suppress the TAG codon.This ratio is independent of the level of transcription, initiation or mRNA stability.Figure 13: Luciferase activity with TQ construction depending of salicylate concentration.We did not obtain the fluorescent signal that we expected with the dimerization agent.We assumed that direct mutations for optimizing the coding sequence of FRB and FKBP and eliminating forbidden site were time-consuming steps.To start we inserted each gBlocks in the intermediate plasmid and then extracted the plasmid coding for our gBlocks.1.1 Tripartite split-GFP and FRB*/FKBP12 dimerization system characterization1.1.3 Test of the dimerization system and tripartite GFP1.2.2.3 Assembling the gBlocks to get the desired biobricks1.2.2.4 Summary of the visualization tool constructionTripartite split-GFP and FRB*/FKBP12 dimerization system characterizationCharacterization of our visualization tool was a two-step process.In comparison to the results obtained with the TAA construction, the readthrough level increases similarly to the concentration of salicylate.Here we showed that the monoclonal anti-GFP antibody epitope are on GFP1.9.Figure 4: Expression of GFP1.9 validated by western blot with monoclonal anti-GFP antibodyOn this western blot control GFP appears between 28 and 38 kDa.Indeed, both activities of Luciferase and bGal drop from 30\u00b5M of salicylate, but luciferase activity was more affected by the salicylate than bGal one.Thus luciferase data were normalized with those from Beta Galactosidase and our results are expressed as the Luciferase/Beta-Galactosidase activity.You can find more details about this on our We designed an experiment to characterize both the tripartite split-GFP and the FRB*/FKBP12 dimerization system.In order to make the bacteria ripe like a real lemon, they decided to take advantage of the fusion protein\u0092s design by using a translational suppression system.TQ: LacZ and Luc coding sequences in the same open reading frame.In turn, decrease of supD amount will result in less codon readthrough and so less translation of the green fusion protein and more translation of the yellow chromoprotein.However, as bacteria grow into agar, less salicylate will remain available into the media.In this part of the project, we faced some difficulties because the plasmids were low copy number.It is important to note that in both biobricks, the two fragments are overlapping to allow an assembly by the Gibson method.This construction is referred as the green fusion chromoprotein.We did not obtained the construct of the dCas9 NM linked to GFP10.In this particular case, the expected fragment was 960bp.They added an amber codon (stop codon) within the linker separating the yellow and the blue chromoproteins genes.This experimental strategy would also allow us to validate the use of the FRB*/FKBP12 dimerization system to build our Bring DNA Closer (BDC) tool.Furthermore, a model was made by bioinformatics tools to estimate the optimum distance between the two dCas9s.Therefore, the sequences we designed were modified to remove forbidden restriction sites, adapted to E.coli codon usage, and have an acceptable GC% and number of repetitions within the sequences.By this mean we are able to determine the optimum distance between the two dCas9s target site for GFP fluorescence.Transformed cells where then incubated with the dimerization agent, rapalog.Thus, the decrease of the nahR-salicylate complex amount within bacteria will lead to supD downregulation through time.We may have some expression issues with FRB*-GFP11 and FKBP-GFP10 as the western blot done with monoclonal antibody anti-GFP allow the revelation of GFP1.9 only.Then they were sent for sequencing to check whether the inserted gBlock had the right sequence.Figure 5:\u00a0: No GFP florescence is observe with rapalog All the rapalog concentrations tested (5nM, 50nM, 500nM) display a signal inferior compared to the negative control.10].The experiment was conducted on three sets of cultures of bacteria:Each of those sets of culture were incubated with three different salicylate concentrations: 0, 30\u00b5M and 1mM.Three clones (clones 1, 2 or 3) were tested for each condition, with three different salicylate concentrations (0, 30\u00b5M or 1mM), with in addition a negative control sample.pcl_TAA construction contains a TAA stop codon between LacZ and Luc.9].Figure 11: Explanatory diagram of the lemon ripening.Figure 12: Explanatory diagram of the characterization.8].Figure 10: Schema of the lemon ripening project.4], the biobrick containing the coding sequences for dCas9 NM linked to GFP10 is composed of two fragments called fragment 1 and fragment 2.Another possibility is that there is some physical constraint that prevent GFP assembly, the linker length for example can generate this kind of constraint.*This wiki was conceived during long nights of work and a great coffee experience in the beautiful Orsay, France.The biobrick containing the coding sequences for dCas9 ST linked to GFP11 is composed of two fragments called fragment 3 and fragment 4.These experiments demonstrate that the BBa_K1372001 biobrick is fully functional.Copyright \u00a9 2016 iGEM Paris Saclay.", "design": "Addition of rapalog allowing dimerization.These two biobricks will be assembled in the pSB1C3 plasmid giving us a BDC tool which would work as presented bellow:Now you can understand why we needed two orthologous dCas9: it avoids us being in the situation where two dCas9-FRB* or two dCas9-FKBP12 are fixed on the DNA!As every system needs an efficient control, we set up a new part of the project in order to assess our Bring DNA Closer tool works properly: the visualization tool.To build this new tool, two other orthologous dCas9s were used and respectively come from the organisms N. meningitidis and S. thermophilus.With this system, only two sgRNAs associated with their dCas9s fused to their specific GFP tags were necessary instead of nearly 30 with mundane GFP due to background fluorescence.We designed three biobricks [Fig4] to achieve this part of the project: BioBrick n\u00b03: dcas9 from N.meningitidis fused to GFP-10 expressed by a constitutive promoter, a RBS and a double terminator BioBrick n\u00b04: dcas9 from S.thermophilus fused to GFP-11 expressed by a constitutive promoter, a RBS and a double terminator BioBrick n\u00b05: The third part of the GFP 1-9 expressed by a constitutive promoter, a RBS and a double terminatorThe biobricks would then be inserted into pSB1C3 by digestion/ligation using the restriction sites EcoRI and PstI.Fig 4: Biobrick designs for the visualization tool.With this system, only two sgRNAs/dCas9s fused to their specific GFP tags are necessary to obtain an accurate fluorescence (Nguyen and al, 2013).We have designed a tool based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target a specific DNA sequence.We finally ordered gBlocks coding for the FRB* and FKBP12 optimized sequences and a linker in prevision of the fusion with their respective dCas9s.Using these two systems (dCas9 recognition and FRB/FKBP12 dimerization) we design our new tool [Figure 2 and Figure 3] based on the two following BioBricks:Fig 2: Final biobrick designs for the BDC tool and dimerization mechanism.Tripartite split-GFP allows fluorescence only if the three parts are maintain close enough.We chose to express sgRNAs on another plasmid pZA11 (cf Fig6) which is compatible with pSB1C3, as it is resistant to ampicilin and do not have the same replication origin.Fig 6: Plasmid containing the sgRNAs specific to their cognate dCas9 and that can be adaptable to target any sequences in the genome.We also decided to use a dCas9 system for this tool in order to detect an accurate and unique sequence in the genome.specificity: the use of orthologous dCas9s allows a specific one by one sgRNA/dCas9 recognition by a specific PAM sequence for each pair (Ma, Hanhui et al.In order to answer this question, we decided to create a new tool based on the CRISPR/Cas9 technology in order to bring closer two DNA regions separated in space.It will be associated with a tripartite split-GFP, which has never been released in the iGEM competition.The tripartite split-GFP is composed of two twenty amino-acids long GFP tags (GFP 10 and GFP 11) and a third complementary subsection (GFP 1-9).We chose this system for its high adaptability, as it targets DNA through a sgRNA which could be easily designed.For a reason you will understand very quickly, we chose two orthologous dCas9s which are respectively expressed by T. denticola (TD) and S. pyogenes (SP).We chose the tripartite split-GFP, which is divided into three different parts: two parts of twenty amino acids corresponding to the 10th and 11th beta-sheets and a third part corresponding to the other beta-sheets of the GFP.We then used a FRB mutated protein sequence (FRB*) that is recognized by rapalog (Bayle and al, 2006).For the visualization tool, we needed a fluorescence system to asses a spatial proximity induced by our system.Color correspond to the two different orthologous dCas9s and to the heterodimerization system.But as mentioned previously, this system is used in mammal cells, so we decided to optimize the sequences for an expression in E. coli with the Jcat platform.dCas9 from Nesseria meningitidis is fused to GFP10 and dCas9 from Streptococcus thermophilus is fused to GFP11.Then, we considered to establish a composite biobrick composed of the three biobricks in the same pSB1C3 plasmid (cf Fig5).Furthermore, the use of E. coli, which is the most common chassis in iGEM, allows us to use biological parts that were constructed and optimized for this bacterium, such as promoters, RBS, terminators, or protein coding sequences.Colors correspond to two orthologous dCas9 To dimerize these two dCas9s, we chose an inducible system using the FRB and FKBP12 proteins [Figure 2].The tags will be fused to the two dCas9 previously quoted.adaptability: the tool would be adaptable to target any sequence in the genome through the sgRNA sequence design.Indeed, the different subunits do not have affinity for each other but can only assemble and emit fluorescence upon excitation when they are all spatially close, which is not the case for a bipartite GFP.This plasmid contain the part of the project that can be change and adapte to any sequences on DNA.Bayle, J. H., Grimley, J. S., Stankunas, K., Gestwicki, J. E., Wandless, T. J., & Crabtree, G. R. (2006).Association of the heterocomplex composed of dCas9s and their sgRNAs recognizing specific target sequences.Indeed, it is the best-known and a well documented bacterial model (Dorman, 2013) to answer fundamental questions such as the one that our project raises.We ordered from Addgene the plasmids coding for each one of these dCas9s and their sgRNAs.Figure 1: Specific DNA sequence recognition by our tool based on sgRNA/dCas9 assembling.Scheme for the three biobricks corresponding to the visualization tool.2015).Our project aims at recognizing specific sequences on the genome and then inducing a spatial proximity.So once we chose a system allowing DNA targeting, we had to choose a system which could dimerize the dCas9/sgRNA, in order to link these two dCas9/sgRNA when they happen to be close enough.A functional GFP would be formed when the tools would be close enough to allow the three split-GFP parts reunion and the fluorescence emission.So we decided to work with the fully mutated FRB.simplicity: to target a DNA sequence, we only have to design a specific sgRNA, which takes about a week.\u0093Multicolor CRISPR Labeling of Chromosomal Loci in Human Cells.\u0094 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.Nguyen, Hau B et al.Originally found in mammals, these two proteins form an heterodimer when rapamycin is added in the middle.dCas9 is a protein which precisely recognizes a DNA sequence (contrary to Cas9, it has no nuclease activity) [Fig1].The rapalog and the plasmid containing the mutated FRB and FKBP12 were offered from Takara Clontech.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 94(15), 7825\u00967830.http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.15.7825Ma, Hanhui et al.The three biobricks have the same promoter, RBS and terminators.A biobrick coding for FRB with the mutation T2098L was already in the iGEM registry (iGEM Part_ J18926) but was not available.We imagined a system that dimerizes under an induction signal to bring two DNA sequences closer.Our experimental strategy is available here.In order to design both our tools, we need molecular tools with specific functions: DNA recognition, DNA binding function, dimerization and fluorescence.These dCas9s will be fused to subunits of a fluorescent protein [Fig5].Moreover, it contains only one mutation on the 3 described in the literature.To avoid any problem of rapamycin toxicity in E. coli, we decided to use an analog of rapamycin called rapalog (gratefully offered by Takara Clontech).", "human_practice": "If the result of the vote is \u0093No opinion\u0094, the Commission is required by the GMO legal framework and by the Charter of Fundamental Rights to adopt a decision on the application so, in practice, has little choice but to give the authorization (European Commission, 2015).Should organisms edited by CRISPR/Cas9 be considered as GMOs?Genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9 represents a specific and efficient tool to generate useful novel phenotypes with an economic interest by base additions, deletions, gene replacement or transgene insertion.The building blocks of the GMO legislation are:Directive 2001/18/EC (12th March 2001) on the deliberate release into the environment of GMO and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC (1990);Regulation 1830/2003/EC (22nd September 2003) concerning traceability and labelling of GMO and the traceability of food and feed products produced from GMO.The directive 2001/18/EC gives the legal definition of a genetically modified organism: \u0093A GMO means an organism, with the exception of human beings, in which the genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination\u0094.If the Member States vote \u0093Yes\u0094, the Commission adopts the draft decision.In the Standing Committee, if Member States vote \u0093Yes\u0094, the Commission adopts the draft decision.If they vote \u0093No\u0094, or if the result of the vote is \u0093No opinion\u0094 (no qualified majority either in favour or against is expressed), the Commission may submit the draft decision to another body representing the Member States at a higher level: the Appeal Committee.Furthermore, several genetic modification techniques yielding organisms to be excluded from the Directive, on the condition that they do not involve the use of recombinant nucleic acid molecules or GMO:cell fusion (including protoplast fusion) of plant cells of organisms which can exchange genetic material through traditional breeding methods.The protection of human health and the environment requires that due attention be given to controlling risks from the deliberate release into the environment of GMOs.If they vote \u0093No\u0094, the Commission cannot adopt the draft decision.Where the results of the risk assessment show that the product does not pose a risk to health or to the environment under the proposed conditions of placing on the market/use, the Commission submits to the Member States, represented in the Standing Committee, a draft implementing decision of authorization, in accordance with the procedure set out in Regulation (EC) No 182/2011 (comitology procedure).Are then considered as genetic modifications:\u0093recombinant nucleic acid techniques involving the formation of new combinations of genetic material by the insertion of nucleic acid molecules produced by whatever means outside an organism, into any virus, bacterial plasmid or other vector system and their incorporation into a host organism in which they do not naturally occur but in which they are capable of continued propagation;techniques involving the direct introduction into an organism of heritable material prepared outside the organism including micro-injection, macro-injection and micro-encapsulation;cell fusion (including protoplast fusion) or hybridization techniques where live cells with new combinations of heritable genetic material are formed through the fusion of two or more cells by means of methods that do not occur naturally.\u0094However, on condition that they do not involve the use of recombinant nucleic acid molecules or GMO, techniques of in vitro fertilization, conjugation, transduction, transformation and polyploidy induction are not considered to result in genetic modification.This procedure is called the \u0093opt-out\u0094 (EurLex, 2015).The EU legal framework on GMOs provides that no GMO or genetically modified food and feed can be placed on the market before it has been granted an authorization in accordance with that legal framework.1 The community legislation within the European Union2 A legislative flexibility for the Member States in the European Union4 Should organisms edited by CRISPR/Cas9 be considered as GMOs?The community legislation within the European UnionThe European Commission is the main actor of the legal framework concerning GMO.The measures set by this directive concerning the procedure for granting consent for the deliberate release and placing on the market of GMOs provide:authorization of release for 10 years and renewable;common risks assessment method for the environment;mechanism enabling the modification, the suspension or the termination of the release;public consultation by an information exchange system (directive 90/220/ESC).The regulation 1830/2003/EC set the framework to ensure products containing GMO and food and animal feed derived from them can be traced at all stages of the production and distribution chain.Under this procedure, Member States vote under the \u0093qualified majority\u0094 defined in the Treaty.It sets that \u0093the Member States may restrict or prohibit the cultivation of GMOs in all or part of their territory as from the date of entry into force of the Union authorization and for the whole duration of the consent/authorization, provided that an established standstill period, during which the Commission was given the opportunity to comment on the proposed measures, has elapsed\u0094.In the Appeal Committee, the Member States vote a second time on the draft decision tabled by the Commission.The precautionary principle, detailed in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, provides that \u0093where scientific data do not permit a complete evaluation of the risk, recourse to this principle may, for example, be used to stop distribution or order withdrawal from the market of products likely to be hazardous\u0094.It appears that organisms edited by engineered nuclease should only fit to the current GMO legislation in the case of transgene insertion, even if the best regulatory issue may be a product base approach.European Commission.", "modeling": "Since we did not have any information concerning the flexibility of our linker, we decided to study both models to cover both cases and maximize the amount of information at our disposal concerning possible end-to-end distances according to flexibility.The Worm-Like Chain model uses the persistence length, which quantifies the stiffness of a polymer, in the calculation of the end-to-end distance.For our linker, we adopted the persistence length value used in the paper Huan-Xiang Zhou (2004): Polymer Models of Protein Stability, Folding, and Interactions, where the probability function is defined as follow:With the equations determining the linker\u0092s end-to-end distance from each model, we wrote a Python program that shows the density of probability distributions of the end-to-end distance in each case.15]\u00a0:Figure 15\u00a0: Final model of our linker 3D spatial configurationSeeing as the Gromacs software is much more complete and reliable than our model, we chose to use the conformation of the linker which presents an end-to-end distance equal to 22\u00c5, in accordance with the Gromacs simulation.The Pymol software allows us to calculate the distance between the two dCas9 proteins: 244.7 \u00c5.Following the conversion equation explained above, we obtain the number of base pairs bp between the target sequences:We can therefore conclude that the distance between the target sequences is approximately 76 base pairs.As such, the configurations we obtained for our linker, conceived to be unfolded, are most likely invalid.So we decided to build two extreme models to try to flank the exact value: one with a small end-to-end distance and another one with a long distance.For the small end-to-end distance, we used one of the PEP-FOLD conformations because even if the configuration seemed unlikely, the protein is maximally folded.11]:Figure 11\u00a0: Result of the linker simulation in 3D, with all distance in \u00c5Compared to the polymer physics models, our model provides additional information concerning the linker, such as the spatial configurations it can take.To sum up, we obtained a mean end-to-end distance of 18\u00c5 with the Ideal Chain model, 27 \u00c5 with the Worm-like Chain model, and 19.66\u00c5 with our model.The fact that the RMSD graph below reaches a plateau justifies limiting the time-course of the dynamics to this value.We chose to plot the linker\u0092s end-to-end distance so as to see the molecular dynamics obtained with Gromacs These results are very close to our model\u0092s unfolded protein length predictions, which reinforces the validity of our model.We also requested the RMSD & RMSF graphs from the Gromacs simulation [Fig.We obtained 107.3 \u00c5.With the preceding linker configurations, we then used the Pymol software to design the 3D model of the entire system and find the distance between the target sequences, lodged in the dCas9 attached to the GFP through the linker, in each case.The ideal and worm-like chain models gave us the order of magnitude of the expected results, but we need to adapt our model to account for steric hindrance, so we decided to develop our own model to describe the behavior of the linker.We wanted our model to provide the end-to-end distance, as well as simulate the linker in 3D.We use this scheme: all bonds have the same length, the angle ? represents the angle between two atoms, and ?, ?, ?, are the dihedral angles [Fig.We also keep the coordinates along the way so as to end up with a 3D representation of our linker.This program was written in Python because this language is suited for biological modeling and the 3D library was suited for the construction of our linker.Thanks to the Pymol software and the literature [1], we know the following constants: The angle ? which represents the angle between each atom in the amino acid\u00a0: 2?/3We also use the Ramachandran plot to determine the appropriate dihedral angles ? and ?.The figure below describes how we constructed our model in 3D.For each segment of our model, we can be in any one of the three following situations [Fig.We also consider that each amino acid is independent concerning its orientation and its position with its neighbor.Thus, we have 36 segments, and the length of each segment is 3.7\u00c5.For N segments with a length of l, the contour length L is the total unfolded length: R is the end-to-end vector, and its mean value writes:According to the central limit theorem, if N>30, the probability density PN (r ?) for the end-to-end distance in the Ideal Chain takes the following Gaussian form:Now that we have the Ideal Chain model equation governing the corresponding end-to-end distance, we will elaborate upon the Worm-Like Chain model which will serve as comparison to the results obtained with the Ideal Chain model.In contrast with the Ideal Chain model, which considers the flexibility of segments in a discrete way, the Worm-Like Chain model considers the flexibility continuously, which is suited for describing semi-flexible polymers.This gives us the number of base pairs:Our conversion relies on several hypotheses: we considered the DNA as a linear B-DNA, and we neglected the structural modification of the DNA due to the fixation of the two dCas9.It appeared that the calculating power of a computer would be more than welcome to estimate the optimal distance through simulation.We first thought of building a simple 3D model using the proteins\u0092 known structures.14] which describe the dynamics of the linker during the 10ns: Figure 14: Linker dynamics video obtained with the Gromacs software In sum, the average end-to-end distance obtained in the Gromacs simulation is akin to that obtained in our model, which supports the assertion that our model does build the linker\u0092s spatial configuration by taking into account steric hindrance effects just as the Gromacs software does, and more generally justifies the reasoning that led to the development of our model.9]:As we can see, the mean end-to-end distance is 19.66\u00c5, and the standard deviation is 7.82\u00c5.The following graph [Figure 10] evaluates if the linker has a preferred orientation.On the graph, each point represents the last segment of the linker compared to the origin.Hence, we decided to approximate the linker\u0092s end-to-end distance through a mathematical equation which describes polymer physics and will provide an estimation of the end-to-end distance of the linker.The difference in the end-to-end distance between the two models is coherent because the Worm-Like Chain model is suited for stiffer polymers that are longer and less folded up than the polymers described with the Ideal Chain model.These results are interesting because we can see that the end-to-end distance results we obtained with the PEP-FOLD prediction and with the mathematical models are quite similar.Our program is designed to give the end-to-end distance on N simulations, and show one simulation of the linker in 3D.For 5000 simulations, we obtain the following histogram [Fig.As such, the smallest end-to-end distance we found with the PEP-FOLD predictions was 16.4 \u00c5.For the long end-to-end distance, we used the linker without any spatial folding, hence in a linear conformation.8]:The segment is the N-C? bond with the ? dihedral angleThe segment is the C?-C bond with the ? dihedral angleThe segment is the C-N peptide bond with a dihedral angle of 0 (a covalent link is planar)The basis of reference is defined as one of the orthonormal bases where U0 is written:All others segments will be expressed in that vector-base.Then, to construct the linker, we need to define a change of basis matrix and consider the first two bonds, since for the peptide bond, ? = 0.The change of basis matrix is composed of a translation matrix Tz, a rotation matrix Rz on the Oz axis and a rotation matrix Rx on the Ox axis.Tz represents the translation of 1.5 \u00c5 corresponding to the segment lengthRz represents the rotation of a dihedral angle ? (which can be ?, ? or 0)We therefore obtain the change of basis matrix: P = Tz * Rz * Rx =And, step by step, we can write the segment i in the basis of the segment 0 and obtain the vector Ui in the reference basis:At every step, we keep in memory the coordinates of each vector for 3D visualization of the linker.To finish, we implemented several improvements to complete our model.We used two polymer physics models to approximate the linker end-to-end distance: the Ideal Chain model and the Worm like Chain model.One explanation for the divergence with the Worm-like Chain model\u0092s result could be that the latter model is less suited for modeling our unfolded flexible linker protein.We will now compare our linker\u0092s spatial configuration results to those produced by the Gromacs software, given the same linker protein sequence.Gromacs is a molecular dynamics package designed for simulating the structure of proteins and other biological molecules.It is to be noted that, while the Gromacs simulation runs in more than 8 hours, our program runs in less than 5 minutes.Now that we retrieved one of the PDB formatted files from the Gromacs simulation, we can build a realistic 3D spatial configuration for our linker inside the Pymol software [Fig.We thus have 36*3=108 segments.Figure 7\u00a0: Scheme used for the elaboration of our modelTo simulate our linker in 3D, we decided to write a program, where we represented each segment by a vector and then added these vectors in the same base.We have also shown that our model provides a reliable estimate of the end-to-end distance, which we have cross-checked with other models\u0092 results, most notably the Gromacs software\u0092s prediction.Ting D, Wang G, Shapovalov M, Mitra R, Jordan MI, Dunbrack RL.13] , so as to extract more information regarding the dynamics of our linker.Figure 13: Results from the Gromacs software for the RMSD & RMSF graphsThanks to Gromacs, we also had a movie [Fig.We found these structures on the RCSB Protein Data Bank and used Pymol to assemble the system.Two identical dCas9 proteins from Streptococcus Pyogenese (instead of Streptococcus Thermophiles and Neisseria Meningitidus in our biological system)A wild type GFP where we removed the 10th and 11th ? sheets to mimic the tripartite GFP.The big limitation of this approach was the lack of information regarding the linker.6] below:Figure 6: End-to-end distance density of probability according to the model usedWe see on this graph the distances predicted by the two models, with a mean of 18\u00c5 for the Ideal Chain model (in blue) and a mean of 27\u00c5 for the Worm-Like Chain model.This affects the distance between the target sequences because curved DNA is longer than straight DNA[Fig.3].Figure 3: Prediction of the system caused by the steric hindranceBefore using this system, we needed to answer a very essential question: what is the optimal distance between the two dCas9 proteins required for GFP to fluoresce?In our model, we can liken the distance between the target sequences to the distance of the two dCas9 proteins, since each sequence is lodged in the core of each dCas9 protein.The color represents the end-to-end distance: the blue color indicates a small or minimal distance, the red color a large or maximal distance.We can visually check that the cloud of linker last segment points follows an angularly homogeneous spherical distribution, where each angle starting from the origin is represented by an equal amount of points.As such, we can conclude that the linker has no preferred orientation.When simulating the linker in 3D, we obtain the following visualization [Fig.However, we cannot conclude anything yet and we cannot develop our model further because we do not have enough information about the stiffness of our linker.Indeed, we can assume that the end-to-end distance is closer to 20\u00c5 than 100\u00c5.According to the equation of conversion above, we acquire a first range of values for the optimal distance between the two target sequences: For the smallest linker, we found a distance of 230\u00c5 which corresponds to 71 base pairsFor the longest linker, we found a distance of 356\u00c5 which corresponds to 110 base pairsThe limit of this approach is the way we modeled the linker, the distance between the target sequences depending on it.In our case, we used one of the PEP-FOLD predictions to run the molecular dynamics.To run the molecular dynamics of the Gromacs software, we followed some steps:1/ we defined a box full of water which simulates the aqueous system.2/ we replaced few water molecules with ions to equilibrate the electrical charges of the solution and obtain electro-neutrality.3/ we relaxed our system to minimal energy to ensure that it does not present any steric clashes or inappropriate geometry.4/ we equilibrated the solvent (water molecules) and ions around the protein5/ we finally ran the molecular dynamics of our linker for 10ns.4].To design the different target sequences, we converted the distance d between the two dCas9 proteins (in Angstrom) into the distance bp on the DNA (in base pair).To conclude, we find a distance of 244\u00c5 between the two dCas9s which correspond to 76 base pairs.These models help us adjust the distance we need for the linker.According to the hypotheses we made, we can conclude that the two dCas9 will be approximately in the same orientation.In this part, we wanted to find the optimal distance between the two dCas9 to visualize the fluorescence.When comparing our results to the ones obtained with these previous models, we observe our model is coherent with the 18\u00c5 result from the Ideal Chain model.To do that, we needed to find the optimal distance between the two target sequences that results in fluorescence.The first constraint for the distance is the following: if the distance between the two dCas9 is too far, the tri-partite GFP may never assemble, as illustrated below [Fig.Indeed, our program does not calculate or show the linker\u0092s dynamics, giving instead a static image of the linker\u0092s spatial configuration at time t. It is to be noted that our program is designed to predict and plot the spatial configuration of an unfolded protein, thus not taking into consideration pre-established ?-helix or ?-sheet types of folding, since the degree of unfolding of the linker of interest here is near 100%.In the end, we obtain one vector U107 that represents the end-to-end vector.Similarly, this spatial configuration is very improbable too, but provides us with the maximal theoretical bound on the end-to-end distance.This allows us to calculate the distance between the two dCas9 proteins based on the distance between the target sequences [Fig.2].Figure 2: Prediction of the system if the distance is too long On the other hand, when the end-to-end distance of the linker is too short, steric hindrance impedes upon the assembling of the GFP-tripartite.Since one helix turn correspond to 10.5 nucleic acids, we can very that there are 76/10.5 = 7.2 helix turn between the two dCas9.Indeed, the linker is supposed to be 100% unfolded because its sequence includes a majority of glycine, whereas some of the PEP-FOLD results showed ?-sheets in the linker\u0092s structure [Fig.The biggest limitation of these models is the fact that we lose information regarding the spatial arrangement of the repeat units and we do not have any information concerning the steric hindrance the repeat units would eventually apply upon each other.If we consider our real polymer chain, the rotation of bonds around the backbone is restricted due to hindered internal rotations and excluded-volume effects.A possible improvement for this model would be the visualization of the molecular dynamics.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "To achieve this goal, we constructed two new biobricks: one composed of a sequence encoding FRB* linked to GFP11 and one composed of a sequence encoding FKBP12 linked to GFP10.The following gBlocks were designed to be assembled with the GFP10 and GFP11 parts as it is illustrated in the strategy page of our wiki (Table 1).Table 1: gBlocks used for the characterization of Tripartite GFP and FRB*/FKBP12 system.We decided to order gBlocks of optimized FRB* and FKBP sequence instead of optimizing the FRB and FKBP coding sequences we got from Takara Clontech ( * shows the optimization that we perform on FRB sequence to be more adaptable to bacteria system).We found out that the 3\u0092 end of the gene encoding dCas9 Td did not match the expected sequence.Due to a lack of time, we decided to put aside the BDC tool construction to focus on constructing the visualization tool as it was mandatory to have it first in order to use it to validate our BDC tool.For this sub-project, we ordered gBlocks thanks to IDT\u0092s offer, and according to our design.To build this tool, dCas9 S. p and dCas9 T. d) were ordered from addgene.org, and the genes encoding the optimized FRB and FKBP12 were obtained by ordering gBlocks from IDT [Table 1].As plasmids we received from addgene.orgwere already transformed into the bacteria, we prepared the overnight culture of received bacteria in order to extract the plasmid coding for dCas9.This one suppresses amber codon allowing the translation of the green fusion chromoprotein.In order to characterize the biobrick, the color switch system (BBa_K13372001) was tested on three different constructions, contained in the plasmid pcl99: TAA: LacZ and Luc coding sequences in the same open reading frame, separated with an ochre stop codon.To sum-up, we were able to construct the biobrick containing the dCas9 ST linked to GFP11 (but with two missing nucleotides) and also the biobrick containing coding sequence for the third part of tripartite GFP (GFP 1-9) but only in the pUC19 plasmid.The sequence was as expected except for the joining of gblocks 3.1-3.2 and 4.1-4.2 where one nucleotide was missing.Concerning the sequence encoding the dcas9 ST linked to GFP11, the ligation between the gBlocks 2.1 and 2.2 did not seem to work as we could not amplify fragment 2 by doing a PCR on the ligation product of fragments 2.1 with 2.2.Finally, the system can by well-constructed and expressed but we may not have found the optimal conditions to induce the dimerization (concentration of rapalog, timing, temperature).In order to characterize our visualization tool, we designed a plasmid (pZA11) in which there are two target sites for dCas9 proteins fused with GFP parts.However, due to a lack of time, we could not achieve the final construction of our plasmid (pZA11) by Gibson assembly method.The BDC tool construct is composed of the dCas9 S. p linked to FRB* and the dCas9 T. d linked to FKBP12 (for further details, check our Design page.This codon is not recognized by the supD suppressor t-RNA\u00a0: no luciferase activity is expected.pcl_Tq construction does not contain any stop codon\u00a0: the luciferase activity is expected to be at the maximal.pcl_TAG contains the TAG codon recognized by supD suppressor t-RNA\u00a0: the expression of luciferase should be inducible by salicylate.Results showed that fragments with the correct size were obtained.Thanks to an overlap between the two fragments (1 and 2, 3 and 4), an overlap between the prefix present at the beginning of fragment 1 and 3 and pSB1C3, and an overlap between the suffix present at the end of fragment 2 and 4 and pSB1C3, we were able to assemble them in pSB1C3 using the Gibson Assembly method.We conclude that supD suppressor tRNA is very specific of the TAG codon and has no impact on the TAA stop codon.Figure 15: Luciferase activity with TAG construction depending of salicylate concentration.Figure 3: Map of the plasmid pSB1C3 coding for FKBP-GFP10 and FRB-GFP11To characterize our system, we tested the expression and integrity of the three protein compounds of the system with western blot.Luciferase activity depends on the expression and capacity of the suppressor t-RNA to read TAG codon.In TAG condition we can see an increase of stop codon readthrough activity with the increase of the salicylate concentration [Fig.Visualization tool is composed of three main parts: the biobrick containing dCas9 NM linked to GFP10 coding sequences, the biobrick containing dCas9 ST linked to GFP11 coding sequences, and the biobrick containing the GFP 1-9 coding sequence.This fragment was obtained for colonies 6 and 8.Figure 9: Migration of colony PCR products obtained from bacteria transformed with the Gibson Assembly of Fragments 3 and 4 in pSB1C3.pcl_TAG contains the TAG codon recognized by supD suppressor t-RNA.The luciferase luminescence is expected to vary depending to the different constructions conditions and to salicylate concentrations, instead of the Beta Galactosidase activity, which will remain constant.Conversely, the down regulation of the suppressor tRNA in absence of salicylate will allow bacteria switch from green to yellow, thus simulating the ripening of a real lemon.Luciferase activity depends on the transcription of pclTAA.The Tq plasmid does not contain any stop codon between LacZ and Luc.Consequently, we did not get a full construct of our visualization tool and thus we were not able to test it.As a part of the characterization of a previous existing Biobrick Part, we have chosen the BBa_K13372001 biobrick from the Paris-Saclay 2014 project This is not a lemon.Finally, the third GFP subunit (1 \u0096 9) biobrick is only composed of the gBlock GFP 1-9.The first step was to check gBlocks, because according to IDT, 80% of the gBlocks have the correct ordered sequence.Gibson Assembly products are then transformed into bacteria, and a colony PCR was performed using primers complementary to the suffix and prefix sequences to screen positive bacteria colonies.Clones 2 and 5 are positive.Assembling the gBlocks to get the desired biobricksWhen sequences were as expected, the same plasmidic DNA extraction products were used to perform high fidelity PCRs, using primers which hybridized at both extremities of the gBlock.But GFP10 and GFP11 are negative.We transformed E.coli with pSB1C3 coding for FKBP-GFP10 and FRB-GFP11 and pUC19 coding for the third part of GFP as we could not clone GFP1.9 in pSB1C3.TAG: LacZ and Luc coding sequences in the same open reading frame, separated with an amber stop codon.Each condition was tested under three different salicylate concentrations.In presence of high salicylate concentration in the agar media, supD will be expressed and so the green fusion chromoprotein: bacteria will display a green color.Therefore, the suppressor tRNA will suppress amber codon allowing the translation of the green fusion chromoprotein in presence of salicylate.Luciferase activity depends on the expression and capacity of the suppressor t-RNA to read TAA codon.In TAA condition, regardless of the salicylate concentration, there is no significant Luciferase activity, so the ratio remains very low at any concentrations [Fig.The decrease of salicylate concentration causes a lost of suppressor tRNA and so on the fall of blue chromoprotein expression\u00a0: bacteria changes from green to yellow.The tRNA used is the supD suppressor tRNA.2]).Figure 1: Map of the plasmid pSB1C3 coding for FRB fused with GFP11 Figure 2: Map of the plasmid pSB1C3 coding for FKBP fused with GFP10We then assembled both plasmids together and constructed the plasmid coding for FKBP-GFP10 and FRB-GFP11 as shown in [fig.Table 2: List and size of gBlocks ordered to build the characterization plasmid and the sgRNA expression system.We successfully inserted all the gBlocks into intermediate plasmids.However, according to the results of PCRs on the extracted plasmids, we could not amplify the coding gene of the dCas9s.These two fragments are themselves respectively composed by the ligation of gBlocks 1.1 and 1.2, and gBlocks 2.1 and 2.2.The third part of the tripartite GFP (GFP1-9) was obtained in the pUC19 plasmid with the expected sequence but its cloning into the pSB1C3 plasmid by digestion/ligation was unsuccessful.As we were afraid the monoclonal antibody recognized only one subunit of the tripartite GFP which was GFP1.9.7] shows the results of this screening for the assembly of fragments 3 and 4 in pSB1C3.The expected product was around 4000 bp and it was found at the expected size for clones 6 and 8.Therefore, plasmids were extracted from the cultures of colonies 6 and 8, and were then stocked and sent for sequencing.When the gBlocks have been validated, they were ready for further manipulation such as Gibson assembly or digestion and ligation techniques to construct our final design.The following gBlocks were designed to construct our Visualization tool [Table 3]:Table 3: gBlocks used to build the visualisation toolFigure 6: Scheme of the visualization tool design.In conclusion, the Psal promoter is fully inducible by salicylate and the suppressor tRNA is functional to suppress the TAG codon.This ratio is independent of the level of transcription, initiation or mRNA stability.Figure 13: Luciferase activity with TQ construction depending of salicylate concentration.We did not obtain the fluorescent signal that we expected with the dimerization agent.We assumed that direct mutations for optimizing the coding sequence of FRB and FKBP and eliminating forbidden site were time-consuming steps.To start we inserted each gBlocks in the intermediate plasmid and then extracted the plasmid coding for our gBlocks.1.1 Tripartite split-GFP and FRB*/FKBP12

validated by western blot with monoclonal anti-GFP antibodyOn this western blot control GFP appears between 28 and 38 kDa.Indeed, both activities of Luciferase and bGal drop from 30\u00b5M of salicylate, but luciferase activity was more affected by the salicylate than bGal one.Thus luciferase data were normalized with those from Beta Galactosidase and our results are expressed as the Luciferase/Beta-Galactosidase activity.You can find more details about this on our We designed an experiment to characterize both the tripartite split-GFP and the FRB*/FKBP12 dimerization system.In order to make the bacteria ripe like a real lemon, they decided to take advantage of the fusion protein\u0092s design by using a translational suppression system.TQ: LacZ and Luc coding sequences in the same open reading frame.In turn, decrease of supD amount will result in less codon readthrough and so less translation of the green fusion protein and more translation of the yellow chromoprotein.However, as bacteria grow into agar, less salicylate will remain available into the media.In this part of the project, we faced some difficulties because the plasmids were low copy number.It is important to note that in both biobricks, the two fragments are overlapping to allow an assembly by the Gibson method.This construction is referred as the green fusion chromoprotein.We did not obtained the construct of the dCas9 NM linked to GFP10.In this particular case, the expected fragment was 960bp.They added an amber codon (stop codon) within the linker separating the yellow and the blue chromoproteins genes.This experimental strategy would also allow us to validate the use of the FRB*/FKBP12 dimerization system to build our Bring DNA Closer (BDC) tool.Furthermore, a model was made by bioinformatics tools to estimate the optimum distance between the two dCas9s.Therefore, the sequences we designed were modified to remove forbidden restriction sites, adapted to E.coli codon usage, and have an acceptable GC% and number of repetitions within the sequences.By this mean we are able to determine the optimum distance between the two dCas9s target site for GFP fluorescence.Transformed cells where then incubated with the dimerization agent, rapalog.Thus, the decrease of the nahR-salicylate complex amount within bacteria will lead to supD downregulation through time.We may have some expression issues with FRB*-GFP11 and FKBP-GFP10 as the western blot done with monoclonal antibody anti-GFP allow the revelation of GFP1.9 only.Then they were sent for sequencing to check whether the inserted gBlock had the right sequence.Figure 5:\u00a0: No GFP florescence is observe with rapalog All the rapalog concentrations tested (5nM, 50nM, 500nM) display a signal inferior compared to the negative control.10].The experiment was conducted on three sets of cultures of bacteria:Each of those sets of culture were incubated with three different salicylate concentrations: 0, 30\u00b5M and 1mM.Three clones (clones 1, 2 or 3) were tested for each condition, with three different salicylate concentrations (0, 30\u00b5M or 1mM), with in addition a negative

fragment 2.Another possibility is that there is some physical constraint that prevent GFP assembly, the linker length for example can generate this kind of constraint.*This wiki was conceived during long nights of work and a great coffee experience in the beautiful Orsay, France.The biobrick containing the coding sequences for dCas9 ST linked to GFP11 is composed of two fragments called fragment

they\u0092ve reached a stop codon, is reduced during the [PSI+] state which we induce via introduction of an extra Sup35 gene fused to a green fluorescent protein (GFP) on a plasmid.Ultimately, triggering of the premature stop codon read-through can control the expression of a target protein and, in this case, allows for the [PSI+] state to return to psi- by Hsp104-mediated curing.As a proof-of-concept, we use the Sup35 prion protein associated with the [psi-] (healthy) / [PSI+] (disease-like) state of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells.The loss in translation terminator activity upon transitioning to [PSI+] increases the likelihood of ribosomes translating the entire CFP::Hsp104 fusion protein due to read-through of the premature stop codon.This is based on the concept that overexpression of Hsp104 beyond an upper threshold cures the [PSI+] state, and repression below a lower threshold prevents propagation of the Sup35 aggregates to daughter cells, thus curing future generations.We also observe the changes between [psi-] and [PSI+] through other phenotypic outputs: the colour of the colonies, and the cellular granularity determined by flow Within a cell in the [PSI+] state the CFP::Hsp104 concentration increases beyond an upper threshold where it effectively disaggregates the Sup35 prions and aids in refolding them into their healthy functional form.While the [PSI+] state develops, the cell\u0092s GFP signal increases due to Sup35::GFP overexpression.[1] Cingaram PKR, Nyeste A, Dondapati DT, Fodor E, Welker E (2015) Prion Protein Does Not Confer Resistance to Hippocampus-Derived Zpl Cells against the Toxic Effects of Cu2+, Mn2+, Zn2+ and Co2+ Not Supporting a General Protective Role for PrP in Transition Metal Induced Toxicity.We hope to contribute to this field by providing a synthetic biology approach that enables an alternative method for metabolic This year, we\u0092ve designed a negative feedback loop using a novel regulatory element capable of overexpressing or repressing target proteins upon transitioning from a neutral state to a prion state.In response, the CFP signal also increases as it is triggered by the loss of translational terminator activity due to aggregated Sup35.By inputting dCas9 in lieu of the Hsp104 ORF in the plasmid, we can use mathematical modeling to predict the ability of optimized sgRNAs to repress the expression of the native Hsp104 gene in the S. cerevisiae genome.Both overexpression and repression of Hsp104, through different mechanisms outlined here, cure the [PSI+] state \u0096 from priON to OFF.Our specially designed fusion of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and a Sup35 disaggregase (Hsp104) has a premature stop codon positioned upstream of CFP\u0092s fluorophore.With fluorimetry, we monitor the changes in the GFP and CFP signal shown in our Results Section.This enables the premature stop codon in the CFP::Hsp104 to prevent full translation of the transcript into its functional form.We also demonstrated that the modified sgRNA allows dCas9 to repress RFP expression with very similar performance.This year, we ve successfully demonstrated that this BioBrick works by showing flow cytometry data indicative of GFP and RFP expression.BioBrick Improvement: Documentation and characterization of BBa_K1645998 and BBa_K1645999 Part of the Waterloo iGEM 2015 project s work involved modifying an sgRNA such that its spacer was flanked by restriction sites to enable exchange of new spacers using basic molecular biology techniques.Additionally, we used a reporter plasmid that contained a GFP gene cassette (BBa_I20260) and RFP gene casette (BBa_204450) for last year s flow cytometry experiments.It is with great enthusiasm that we present a study of the

concern that the additions would disrupt the scaffold secondary structure and affect dCas9 s performance.We use read-through of a premature stop codon in fusions with Hsp104 or dCas9 to respectively overexpress or repress Hsp104.Brain?: A Journal of Neurology, 138(Pt 4), 992\u00961008.By educating our community about the attributes that inherently contribute to the likelihood of Jamboree success,

usually about 20nt, which specifies the target site on the genome(Cong, 2013; Jinek, 2012).Figure 1: CRISPR action, demonstrating how Cas9 binds to sgRNA to cleave target DNA.CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is a system used for targeting specific sites of a genome (Cong, 2013; Jinek, 2012).If we use our system to insert a premature stop codon in front of the CRISPR gene, then it will only be expressed during a [PSI+] state.Figure 2: CRISPRi knockdown action, demonstrating how dCas9 binds to sgRNA to prevent expression.Most CRISPR systems use a Cas protein called Cas9 which makes a cut after binding to the DNA.This function of the CRISPR system allows for a targeted knockout of a protein in question.Our system is a tool that allows the overexpression a protein of interest, which could be used to determine if the protein can slow the [PSI+] response or even cure it.The addition of a CRISPR interference system using dCas9 allows the targeting a protein of interest to cause this knockdown of expression.Our system would use dCas9 which is a Cas protein that binds to a site and prevents transcription of that protein.CRISPR is a very popular tool in genome editing because of its ability to cut specific sites, however it was originally discovered as an adaptive immune system in bacteria (Doudna, 2014).It would also be useful to see if the opposite (a decrease in the expression of a protein of interest) could have similar effects.The sgRNA recognises the target DNA, thereby acting as an intermediate between the Cas protein and the target.This sequence is recognised by the Cas protein and is thus necessary for it to bind to the sgRNA.Genome Biology, 17(1), p.45.Science, 346(6213), pp.1258096\u00961258096.The most common PAM

colony.Repeat the process for each of the microfuge tubes and record which patch plates corresponds to which microfuge tubes.Similar to PCR amplification, the Polymerase Chain Reaction reagent requires DNA templates, forward and reverse primers, nucleotide containing buffers and nuclease free water to dilute the mixture.If the DNA is to be sent for sequencing, nuclease free water must be used to elute instead of elution buffer.Allow elution buffer to incubate in spin column for 1 minute, and centrifuge to elute the DNA out of spin column.Polymerase Chain Reaction takes a segment in a DNA template and amplifies it from a few copies in stock solution up to several order of magnitude by the assembly of primers and nucleotides along the template.Each cycle of PCR includes a denaturation, annealing and elongation step.The result should be individual cell colony growth on the agar surface containing the plasmid DNA in each cell.The ligation mixture is then allowed to react under room temperature for 4 \u0096 24 hours.Base volume of vector and insert DNA from nanodrop concentration and add desired amount in nanograms (ng)The insert : vector ratio should be 3:1 to 5:1 depending on size of insert and vector.The basicity of the lysis buffer causes the cells to break open and expose their contents.Add 400 uL of Neutralization Buffer to renature the plasmid DNA and bring up the pH of the mixture.The lysis process is followed with denaturation to make single stranded DNA templates, annealing step to attach primers to the single strands of DNA and finally an elongation step in which assembles complementary nucleotides extending from the primers and along the DNA templates.Cell lysis and initial denaturation : 95 oC - 10 minutesAnnealing temperature is determined by the Tm of the primers currently in use.Add 200 uL Lysis buffer to the cell mixture, invert the tube 5 times to mix and incubate at room temperature for 1 minute.Once the program has opened, press \u0093Startup\u0094 button and allow 45 minutes for the software to initialize.To prepare the samples, add cold 1X formalin to cell culture in a 3:1 ratio.The gel is now ready to be imaged under UV light.Find the target DNA size to determine the band position that needs to be extracted from the gel and cut it out.Yield may be increased if the flow through is reloaded into the column and centrifuged once more.Add 500 uL of wash solution to purify DNA and centrifuge for 30 seconds.Gel red is dissolved in the agar to allow for DNA visualization under UV light.Washing step can be repeated for higher purity.Transfer the spin column to a clean 1.5 mL tube and elute with 20 \u0096 30 uL preheated (65 oC) elution buffer.Incubate for 1 minute and centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute.The negatively charged DNA will travel to the positive electrode when carried by the current.Apply 100 \u0096 150 V to the gel and let the DNA travel for approximately 1 hour.The DNA should be purified from contaminations in the previous steps.Annealing step involves the association of single stranded DNA template with primers which attaches to the 3\u0092 end on both template strands.The second negative control contains no ligase to test any ligation activity without the enzyme.This process results uptake of DNA into a competent cell and allowing the said cells to express these exogenous genes, a core aspect of synthetic biology.In each patch spaces, pipette 10 uL of cells from the microfuge tubes and eject it directly within the patch.Using a 10 uL pipette, transfer the samples into the wells of the agarose gel and record the sample position.Apply the positive electrode at the opposite end of the wells and the negative electrode on the well\u0092s end of the tray.Depending on the size of the gel rig, typically 50 uL - 100 uL, ensure the correct amount of agarose in grams is measured on an analytical balance.Measure out TAE to achieve the desired gel concentration and add it to the flask.Meanwhile a value of \u00931\u0094 indicate a perfect sphere, which is the speed-beads used to break up cell clumps.Type II restriction enzymes, such as EcoRI and PstI, allows you to cut at specific palindromic sites on multiple target DNA and attach them to one another by ligation of the complementary ends.The computer should briefly display the results of the analysis in real time, including the images of individual cell fluorescence and graph value.When data is ready to be recorded, enter \u009320,000\u0094 as the cell count and set the destination of data storage.Gel electrophoresis uses electric current to move the negatively charged DNA to move towards the positive electrode through the agarose gel matrix.Draw up, using a 10 uL pipette tip, individual colonies from selective media.Eject the cells from the pipette tip and aspirate until no visible clumps of cells remain.Pour the molten gel into a casting tray and insert the comb to create wells, the gel will take 20 \u0096 25 minutes to solidify.Resuspend cells in 200 uL of resuspension buffer to digest RNA after the cells have been lysed.Ligase buffer must make up 10% of the total ligation reactionFor every ug of DNA in mixture, 1 uL of ligase must be addedTwo negative controls have to be set up for future ligation troubleshooting.The DNA concentration and purity is now ready to be quantified by nanodrop.Ligation involves attaching two segments of DNA together and is key to inserting genes into an open cut in a plasmid.Transfer spin column to a clean 1.5 mL microfuge tube and elute with 20 \u0096 30 uL of preheated (65 oC) elution buffer.Unlike the standard PCR amplification step, this protocol\u0092s purpose is solely to determine the presence of insert DNA in plasmids of transformed cells.16, 339-346Inoculate strain to be transformed into 10 mL YPD and grow overnight at 30 oC and 230 rpm on the Glerum Lab shaker.By the time the colonies in the patch plates

H. and Gietz, R. D. (1989) High efficiency transformation of intact yeast cells using single stranded nucleic acids as carrier.The plasmid DNA concentration and purity is now ready to be quantified in concentration through nanodrop.Weigh out agarose to make 0.8 \u0096 1.2 % gel concentration and pour into an Erlenmeyer flask.", "result": "The high copy number plasmid under observation is PXP218 and the low copy

counterparts.However, this addition of metabolic load has been observed to not be significant enough in that transformed cells could grow normally.Low copy number observation: Throughout the 72-hour period, cells with PRS315 plasmids have an overall lower growth rate than No Plasmid cells.Since this result is to be expected and the slower growth rate is within acceptable values, it can be

synthetic genes that not only has enhanced DNA repair mechanisms, but also has an entire artificial pathway introduced for the elimination of mutant strains from a population.Combining our sequence-based strategies with the introduction of exogenous genes and removal of endogenous genes has enabled us to produce an expression platform for synthetic genes that not only has enhanced DNA repair mechanisms, but also has an entire artificial pathway introduced for the elimination of mutant strains from a population.Not only is the BDP a more robust promoter, having the protein of interest expressed at the same time as antibiotic resistance or an essential endogenous gene guarantees that any mutation in the promoter would eliminate the cell from the population.The possibilities are endless for the combination of these enzymes in a cell to minimize evolutionary potential.Our strategies target the three levels at which genetic constructs are implemented in engineered biological systems- the physical DNA sequence, its genomic and circuit context, and lastly the entire organism which is host to the synthetic DNA.Our project first demonstrates the power of this rational synthetic gene design strategy by employing several canonical as well as highly original protocols for assaying DNA damage and its effects on the stability of artificial genetic elements.Our project first demonstrates the power of this rational synthetic gene design strategy by employing several canonical as well as highly original protocols for assaying DNA damage and its effects on the stability of artificial genetic elements.Because the cell is engineered to be incapable of repairing double-strand breaks, if any the bases in its genome are ever mutagenized in a way that these enzymes can recognize, the cell would effectively commit suicide instead of becoming a mutant.Ceroni F, Algar R, Stan GB, Ellis T. Quantifying cellular capacity identifies gene expression designs with reduced burden.Here are a few enzyme that are included for the mutation optimization of the cell:T4 PDG (T4 Endonuclease V) is an enzyme which specifically recognizes UV induced cyclobutane pyrimidine photodimers and creates a nick in the DNA strand through its glycosylase and APlyase domains.Whether in a multifaceted genetic circuit or a simple protein expression platform, mutation is inevitable, and once it disrupts function, the organism will no longer experience the burden of transgene expression, causing the mutant to outcompete whatever has the intended sequence.This would allow the cell to have a specific response to irradiation which is better than the constitutively expressing the protein for reasons aforementioned, mainly the increase in metabolic load.The cell will not only try to get rid of the foreign DNA because of its associated metabolic load, the sequence will be prone to mutations that either cause a nonfunctional or dysfunctional protein product.One method of improving evolutionary stability is the inclusion of a bidirectional promoter (BDP) which concurrently transcribes two monocistronic genes.Another way of decreasing the rate of mutation is to lessen the metabolic load on the cell.Introduction of T4 PDG to the cell would increase the cell\u0092s resistance to UV irradiation and lessen the rate of mutation.This is being used by us to integrate several repair enzymes that will maintain the fidelity of genomic DNA while removing error-prone polymerases endogenous to the cell.Empirical research demonstrated that after 60 generations, a circuit under the control of a constitutive promoter completely lost its function but the same circuit under an inducible promoter still had 25% of its original expression [6].This mutator state under stressful conditions from increased metabolic load is important for adaptive evolution but is counterproductive to the goals of synthetic biologists attempting for stable expression [].We took a three-pronged approach to minimize mutation by both repairing mutations that occur and preventing mutagenesis from happening.And inducible promoter has the advantage of only increasing the metabolic load for a limited time that is tightly controlled.Engineering organisms with recombinant DNA puts strain on the metabolism of the organism which can reduce the cell\u0092s fitness.In the context of VERT, this means that the cell population would maintain the same rate of expression for all three fluorescent proteins rather than have them vary with respect to one another over time.It has been demonstrated that increasing the metabolic load of the cell decreases its rate of replication which is directly correlated to its Darwinian fitness.To this end, it is of great importance that these circuits remain stable however current design guidelines used by the synthetic biology community are especially prone to mutation.Studies show that reducing expression 4-fold can increase the evolutionary half-life of the circuit 17-fold [6].Introduction of FPG to the cell would allow the cell to effectively repair oxidative damage and reduce the rate of mutation due to replication fork stalling.Evolution and mutation work hand in hand to select against the maintenance of synthetic DNA sequences.Over time, each circuit has the potential to reach a particular equilibrium point of protein expression giving the cell population a unique color.Our strategy has a strong foundation in a rich literature from the fields of cancer biology and others that have annotated and characterized mutation hotspots for almost every conceivable source of mutagen, from ultraviolet radiation to recombination to polymerase errors.Our strategy has a strong foundation in a rich literature from the fields of cancer biology and others that have annotated and characterized mutation hotspots for almost every conceivable source of mutagen, from ultraviolet radiation to recombination to polymerase errors.Initial research indicates that the inclusion of a BDP doubles the evolutionary half-life [7].Cells that have to produce are less adapted to their environment and are more likely to be outcompeted in a heterogeneous population where other cells are not under the same load [].This enzyme could be introduced to the cell and in conjunction with the previous three which generate nicks, would ensure a complete double stranded break at every damaged location.Other enzymes such as AlkB for removal of methyl groups and MGMT for repairing alkylated basepairs are just a few examples of other Base Excision Repair enzymes.To combat this issue, many have developed sophisticated killswitch circuits, but what has not been addressed is the degradation of this safety mechanism which is subject to more evolutionary pressure than other components due to its lethality.This can be quantified by using VERT (Visualizing Evolution in Real Time), a technique that uses three different fluorescent proteins to investigate the stability dynamics created by the transcriptional interactions of these three genes [6].We are proposing a novel approach based on rationally designed genomic architectures that promises to offer synthetic biologists unprecedented control over the evolutionary stability of their creations.Both the circuit and the genes composing it are subject to mutation resulting in inactivation and the spread of GMO [3].From these techniques, we can quantify everything from the selective subset of mutation types occurring on an in vitro level, up to how mutational loss of function translates at the scale of populations of genetically modified organisms.From these techniques, we can quantify everything from the selective subset of mutation types occurring on an in vitro level, up to how mutational loss of function translates at the scale of populations of genetically modified organisms.Homology with endogenous genomic areas, intra-circuit homology of various components, and even among BioBrick scar sites left over from assembly can all have a substantial harmful impact on the gene network [5].In terms of production, bioreactors are especially vulnerable to gene mutation due to the metabolic stress exhibited by the cells in such an environment.T7 Endonuclease I is an enzyme which cleaves DNA creating a double-stranded break within 3 basepairs 5\u0092 of the mismatched DNA.Currently, prokaryotic promoters are particularly susceptible to mutation however a BDP has the advantage of self-protection by overlapping essential promoter sequences on both strands of the DNA.All of synthetic biology is impacted by the instability of genes, but there are several areas where it is of particular concern, namely manufacturing, medicine, and biosafety.At the heart of our strategy is an advanced computational algorithm that integrates decade\u0092s worth of scientific data in order to identify and correct the highly-mutation prone \u0091hotspots\u0092 that lurk in every gene.The source of life s great diversity - spontaneous mutation - is for the synthetic biologist the source of constant apprehension and risk.The homology of the circuit was also reduced to minimize the similarities among the promoters, RBS, terminators as well as the fluorescent protein coding regions.In the case of T4 PDG, the enzyme could be put under the control of an umuDC promoter which is UV dependent.Finally, a prokaryote that employs all these enzymes, in addition to the mechanism of on-homologous end joining knocked out, has the opportunity to be the ultimate killswitch.In addition to simply adding in the enzymes by themselves or in some sort of combination, we have devised a system for a more precise repair mechanism.At the heart of our strategy is an advanced computational algorithm that integrates decades worth of scientific data identify and correct the highly-mutation prone  hotspots  that lurk in every gene.To complement our work, we have harnessed our algorithm for use in what is becoming one of the most important tools for engineering biological molecules: directed evolution experiments.To complement our work, we have harnessed our algorithm for use in what is becoming one of the most important tools for engineering biological molecules: directed evolution experiments.FPG is an enzyme which finds 8-oxoguanine base pairs, which are the result of oxidative damage, and excises them.Moreover, the load of translating active proteins that create their own secondary metabolites compounds the stress on the cell leading to further decreased fitness.One of the most crucial things that can easily debilitate a circuit is sequence homology.Finally, the polycistronic potential of the genetic network was increased by including a bidirectional promoter between the first and second protein ensuring synchronized transcription.Not only can our engineered changes increase evolutionary stability in applications such as transgenic bioreactors, but it can also construct gene sequences that are more prone to mutate, thus accelerating studies into how to use evolutionary selection to produce tailored functional modifications to proteins.Not only can our engineered changes increase evolutionary stability in applications such as transgenic bioreactors, but it can also construct gene sequences that are more prone to mutate, thus accelerating studies into how to use evolutionary selection to produce tailored functional modifications to proteins.Indeed, the mantra has been that time in the form of mutation and evolution will always find a way to erode and ultimately destroy everything that an engineer builds, no matter how ingeniously it may designed.Similarly, genetically modified organisms that are introduced to the environment have the possibility to escape their intended area as well as transfer their genes to other organisms.All of these issues are driven by the effect of metabolic load and selective pressures on genes which cause them to either be inactivated or deleted.In addition to heteroduplexes, the enzyme also cuts cruciform structures, Holliday junctions, and to a lesser extent, nicked dsDNA.Unlike the previous enzyme, FPG completely removes the site by cutting 5\u0092 and 3\u0092 to the base pair.Following the same reasoning as above, replacing constitutive promoters with inducible ones substantially decreases the stress on the cell.Genetic circuits have become the mainstays of synbio as the machinery through which biological processes are executed and controlled.The pKIKO (Knock-In-Knock-Out) system allows for the simultaneous replacement of genomic DNA and integration of foreign DNA.Additionally a P2A peptide, an autocatalyzing self-splicing linker, was included between the second and third protein guaranteeing synchronized translation.",

motivated in the thought that while there are selective pressures in the environment, those selective pressures were the exact cause of the increased fitness level (reduced metabolic load).In the model, the mutant cell type has a slightly higher fitness level than the control population, on the level of we approximate one and five percent.So on the order of magnitude of days, the makeup of a cell population can change.Figure 4 shows the relationship between fitness advantage and the number of generations it takes for the mutant cell type to overtake the wild cell type.One would assume, from basic cellular biology, and logical reasoning that this smaller population of cells, with a higher level of fitness, could quickly become the dominant cell type in the population.However, introduce a mutant cell with fitness level f = 1.5, and this cell type will quickly grow past the equilibrium level of the ecosystem, as it is able to more efficiently use its resources, and thus divide faster.To model cell type population dynamics, the Price equation was implemented.The Price equation is a recursive model based on four factors (for our model); cell type 1 population size, cell type 2-population size, cell type 1 fitness level, and cell type 2 fitness level.Therefore the growth model is exponential, and once the mutant cell type gains steam it can easily take over the population.Within the scale of between 10 and 20 generations a mutant cell population can go from the break even point to overwhelming the wild type.The higher a fitness advantage, the less time it takes a cell population to reach the break-even point.Figure 3 is a more zoomed in version of the previous figure.With these four inputs, the recursive Price equation can predict the percentage of the cell population taken over by the mutant cell type.We call this point the break-even point, and it represents the point at which the mutant population and the wild type population are equal.This is of utmost importance, in that it gives us a model to approximate what the level of fitness gained would be for the loss of a certain circuit or gene sequence.for every increase in the mutant population there is a corresponding decrease in the wild type population.The crux of the Price equation is that the fitness level is proportional to how efficiently a cell will reproduce.It shows how quickly a cell population can go from the break even point to completely dominating the population.In the competition graph models we see the downward sloping curve represents the population of the wild type, and the upward sloping curve represents the population of the mutant type.Each data point represents the time at which a mutant type cell with that level of fitness advantage will overwhelm the wild cell type.In most cases, the number of generations it takes to go from the break-even point to the point at which the mutant cell line takes over is on the order of between 10 and 20 generations, or roughly 1-2 days.For example, a cell type with fitness level of f = 1 would reproduce at a rate of 1 cell per generation.We included a scaling factor that is a ratio of the two cell populations.Figure 1 shows the effect of a density dependent scaling factor on the Price Equation.Ratio of cell deaths to births is equal, and the total population stagnates at a certain equilibrium level.Therefore it is of importance to see how a circuit with a reduced metabolic load will function in population of cells.Empirical data gathered by our team suggests that this is consistent with the model, in that the time from break-even to total take over is roughly on the order of 1-2 days (for an RFP expressing circuit).For our model, we use a simplified version of the Price equation that keeps fitness levels constant from generation to generation.Now, introduce a small separate population of cells into this original population, and these cells have a reduced metabolic load.", "notebook": "",

of conducting responsible research.Some of the topics included were:As Dr. Collins noted at the end of our event, \"these questions are not easy to answer.Dr. Collins has been trying to start a dialogue in the synthetic biology community about new advances like \"gene drives\", which may have the potential to drive entire species into extinction.Dr. Collins was enthusiastic about the

Collins, our team joined Dr. Collins for dinner, where we continued the conversation on bioethics and asked for his thoughts on our project to reduce mutation.Dr. Collins is the former Director of the Population Biology and Physiological Ecology program at the National Science Foundation and the current Ullman Professor of Natural History and the Environment at Arizona State University, where he studies evolution and extinction in natural ecosystems.While these technologies may have enormous potential in preventing malaria, as Dr. Collins noted in his seminar, there are some significant ethical questions that need to be carefully considered.As our team was developing our project ideas at the beginning of the year, we had the tremendous fortune to meet with Dr. James Collins from Arizona State University, who was giving a special seminar at our university.He was a lead author on the recent report Creating a Research Agenda for the Ecological Implications of Synthetic Biology, where he has raised some important yet under-emphasized questions in the potential effects that genetic technologies could have on the stability of natural ecosystems.Our software calculated that it is possible to reduce the number of these UVB pyrimidine dimer sites by over 40% in the human p53 gene, which given the correlation between these sites and the mutations responsible for human cancers, would likely bring about a substantial decrease in the incidence of oncogenic mutation.More recently, Professor Bess has been focusing his research on the relationship between technology and society, work for which he has won a fellowship from National Human Genome Research Institute.Among the key issues that professor Bess raises in his book is whether or not society as a whole has fully considered the future consequences that these technologies may have, or if the pace of technologies like genetic engineering has exceeded society s capacity to prepare for and evaluate the dramatic changes these technologies could bring.Recently, Dr. Collins has become involved in questions of synthetic biology and how it relates to responsible ethological and ethical practice.", "keywords":

a more temperature stable form of oxytocin using E.coli and/or yeast: The third, and original goal, of our project was to directly address the short half-life and need for refrigeration of the life-saving drug oxytocin.Our next step was to order several shuttle vectors from AddGene so we could produce more of our part using E.coli, mini-prep it out, and transform it into yeast where it would express the proteins required for our oxytocin receptor to form on the cell s surface, and when oxytocin is detected, trigger the FUS-1 mating pathway and produce measureable green fluorescent protein.2) Create an oxytocin quality sensor using a G-protein coupled receptor in yeast: The second goal of our project was to design and test a diagnostic system for medication quality that leveraged G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in yeast.1) Design and build low-cost open source biotools: Denver, allowed our team to build many of the tools we use in the lab including a fluorimeter, an optical density sensor, a DNA concentration meter, an incubator, a refrigerated centrifuge, and a yeast dryer, which we will be exhibiting at the Jamboree expo as part of our \"Hardware\" track deliverables.We are working to improve upon their part by experimenting with different secretion tags to facilitate easier We are still working on this aspect of the project, researching possible mechanisms for producing the human oxytocin protein using yeast, and exploring possible temperature regulation mechanisms to mitigate the instability of this essential medication.In our work on this aspect of the project we experimented with different reporters, yeast promoters and terminators, yeast strains, and selection techniques.Our goal was to use the same GPCR approach to design yeast that could detect active oxytocin in order to determine if the medication sample was expired or not.The goal of the Lethbridge team was also to create a longer-lasting form of oxytocin by adding precursor molecules to slow the hormone s degradation.We therefore wanted to design a system where engineered yeast could be \"dried\" similar to the process for bakers and brewers yeast, shipped in inexpensive packets at room temperature, and reconstituted on site to preform the intended diagnostic funtion.We also used a four-button Olimex LCD screen, which required re-mapping functions to the four different buttons, and adding DNA concentration calculations to the code base.The fluorimeter and optical density sensor we built was based on a design by the 2014 Aachen iGEM team.We used 3A assembly to remove the composite part which included a yeast promoter, a RBS, our OXTR part, a terminator, and the FUS-1 and EGFP parts from TU-Delft.We relied on the DIY receptor design instructions created by oxytocin GPCR.We also requested a part iGEM HQ submitted by the Lethbridge Canada 2013 iGEM team .Different colored filters can be inserted interchangeably into the cuvette holder to filter different frequencies of light, and thus detect opitcal density or fluoresence or DNA concentration.We have begun work on this aspect of the project in several ways.We began by designing our receptor using SnapGene (one of our generous sponsors) and having it synthesized by IDT (for free as part of their sponsorship of iGEM 2016, thank you!)", "design": "Place a piece of sturdy tape across 1/3 of

the epoxy out...set up your liquid media bottle!Fill the media bottle with liquid yeast culture, turn on the air compressor (hooked up to the airgun on the top of the column/vortex).We also noticed during our test runs that the vacuum bag on the exhaust manifold collected quite a bit of yeast, so a second powder separation column should be added to future designs of this dryer.(Optional) We used a piece of Ecovative Myco Foam we grew to create padding that sits on thePreparing to cut the myco foam to fit the diameter of the columnUsing a drywall saw to cut the myco foam for the stand supportColumn sitting in dryer stand with myco foam support To operate our fully assembled yeast dryer, you will need a ladder, two blow dryers, a power strip, liquid yeast culture, and an air compressor to provide the pressure for the airgun.The dried yeast falls to the bottom of the column and is collected, while the excess air is vented out.And finally, we would explore different coatings for the inside of the column that could help prevent the yeast from getting stuck to the insides of the column.The 0.7mm nozzle sprayed too much liquid, and contributed to a lot of the yeast sticking to the sides of the column.To avoid this in future iterations, we would explore using higher velocity and hotter air in the heating manifold and the column.Cut two three-inch slits 10 inches apart in the middle of the 20\" cylinder (see image below) 2.Cut a small hole in the bottom of the liquid media bottle and epoxy a piece of tubing with the airgun attachment on the other end into the

windows into the column so we could watch the activity inside the column during test runs.We found that the \"warm\" setting on high for the blow-dryer blowing into the vacuum attachment and high, hot setting on the heating manifold blow-dryer worked the best.Attach the 8\"-to-6\" reducer to the 14\"-to-8\" reducer and the 6\"-to-4\" reducer to the 8\"-to-6\" reducer.Place 45-degree street and

sterile hood during transformations (reducing the risk of liquid disinfectant being sprayed on any electrical connections).10 high-power LEDs (up to around 2 Watts each), with 2 each of 5 different colours (red, true green, blue, ultra-white 6000K, and infrared 850nm) that can be programmed in circadian rhythms, allowing you to choose the wavelength and the intensity of light that is best for

your samples from anywhere with an internet connection (and also to produce time-lapses)  A thermistor and LDR for measurement and analysis of temperature and light conditions throughout growth (the growth chamber produces tables of this information which can be imported into Excel), as well as for feedback to the \u0093Peltier\u0094 element  Fans for controlling air circulation in the growth chamber, and for cooling electronic components The design of this growth facility is fully documented, and published in a full tutorial on Instructables and our wiki, with the intention that anyone who wants to will be able to find the tutorial and follow it without difficulty, regardless of experience.This growth chamber houses 1 petri dish.Easy to surface sterilise the gun and base for use in sterile fume hood.We plan to test the gun in early September by transforming onion bulb cells with a GFP or GUS reporter system, experimenting with optimisation of the firing pressure for the gun and documenting penetration of the cell target qualitatively.The connections in the gun have all been pressure tested under water and sealed using PTFE tape, to ensure the gun is safe for repeated use.The gun is mounted on a clamp stand and wooden base, with all the electronics contained inside the box on the left (the gun would go inside the sterile fume hood and the box could be left on the bench outside).The reason I made this design decision was that housing multiple petri dishes in the same growth chamber would have resulted in inconsistent conditions in temperature and lighting (and larger material costs), whereas having multiple chambers joined together wouldn\u0092t have had any obvious advantages over building several separate units, in order to justify the extra material costs and effort required under the time pressure.If one wanted to house several petri dishes, the options would be to either build separate units, or to modify the CAD files and acquire extra components (the CAD files will be uploaded to the wiki and Instructables along with the tutorial) in order to house the extra petri dishes.Improve efficiency of Peltier element by adding extra fan to remove air from the \u0093hot side\u0094 Add H-bridge, allowing the Peltier to be controlled as both a heater and a cooler It was originally intended to house both the 5V power supply and the 700mA LED driver within the electronics enclosure, however, due to Jake s hastiness with soldering, Jake accidentally soldered the LED driver to the mains cable before putting the mains cable through the hole for external cabling, so that the LED driver now doesn\u0092t fit through the hole.Both will be available at a fraction of the cost of commercially available equivalents.The ultimate goal of the project is to achieve homoplasmy in Chlamydomonas chloroplasts much more quickly than the 2-3 months of repeated antibiotic selection currently taken \u0097 ideally, over the span of a single generation.Our method relies on double transformation of Chlamydomonas chloroplast with a cassette-of-interest (CoI) and the highly customisable \u0093driver\u0094 cassette that we are developing.(1) It operates at 140 psi, while most similar designs online use 600-700 psi, and most commercial ones around 1350 psi, (2) all electronics are contained inside a box, so no electrical connections are exposed, (3) additional circuit fuses are included and are specifically rated for the current going through, (4) all components are tested separately for leaks and electrical safety.Within the field of synthetic biology, there has recently been a necessity for low-cost, DIY, biological lab equipment in order to maintain the momentum at which the field is developing.Limited by the 10-week duration of the iGEM project, we are unlikely to complete all the necessary experiments to verify our Cas9 strategy, but the library would also have a standalone value and enable future work in this area.One of the project aims is to design, build and document a full protocol for a low-cost gene gun.The gene gun will be designed to use lower-cost consumable options, such as easily-replaceable CO2 cartridges.The design will also incorporate safety features for the user, which are generally neglected in existing DIY designs available online.Finally, the lack of modular chloroplast genetic parts available makes gene cloning significantly more time-consuming and cumbersome.The goal of our project is to remove some bottlenecks from chloroplast engineering, and provide grounds for future work aimed at removing more.Our team\u0092s growth chamber allows you to optimise the conditions and to record and analyse the growth of your 90 mm petri dishes at a fraction of the cost of the commercially available equivalents, regardless of the samples you re growingTotal cost \u00a3228.05, with just the safety shield for the gun left to assemble.One of the obstacles is the time it takes (2-3 months) to achieve homoplasmy (a state in which all the copies of chloroplast DNA have been transformed are therefore stable), which is required for analysis of colonies to be performed.This would remove the selection pressure for the \u0093driver\u0094, which might then be lost.This design has been the result of discussions with many scientists in the field, safety considerations resulting from our integrated human practices and theoretical work.On the other hand, mammalian expression systems have poor expression yields, require complex media and growth conditions, and are very sensitive to contamination with pathogens.The use of microalgae chloroplasts as an alternative expression system solves most of these issues and offers many other advantages.Suspend carrier particles on a parafilm membrane which ruptures at the target pressure.The high-velocity microparticles can penetrate plant cell walls, enabling transformation of plastids such as the chloroplast, which we will use in our project.As useful as this technique is, the cost of commercially-available biolistic systems can run into the tens of thousands of pounds, making them unattainable for smaller laboratories and the hobbyist Syn Bio community.The final prototype will also include a ruler clamped alongside the gun to measure distance to the target plate on firing.These can be used in developing countries, where classical vaccines are unaffordable and hard to store and apply safely.On top of providing an attractive expression platform, chloroplasts are the target of a lot of research, aiming to increase yields of oils for biofuels, elucidate photosynthetic machinery and improve C fixation to combat the international food crisis.Our design will feature similar functions to these systems, allowing optimisation of firing pressure, duration and distance from the target, but for just 1% of their cost.You are welcome to track the changes in our design in the Notebook section under \"Plasmid design update\" and \"Plasmid design update vol 2\", along with explanations about why changes were made.A library of chloroplast parts in PhytoBrick standardWe are also developing a library of chloroplast genetic components, compatible with the recently developed and highly modular PhytoBrick standard for the assembly of gene units.Successfully transform plant cell target at the low pressure levels generated by the gun, relative to commercial gene guns.This will fit over the electronics box and gun trigger when stored, so the user must consciously handle the safety screen before firing the gun and will thus be reminded to use this safety feature.Microalgae chloroplasts are an attractive platform for the production of recombinant proteins, and are targets of considerable research aiming to optimise carbon fixation and lipid biosynthesis.They also have a range of post-translational modification pathways, and possess chaperones and disulfide isomerases, which allow for the correct folding of multi-component proteins.Unlike in higher plants, metabolic energy in microalgae is not directed towards maintaining complex differentiated structures, further enhancing transgene expression (which can total up to 30-50% of a cell\u0092s dry biomass).In addition to the outstanding transgene yields, microalgae are also very amenable to farming worldwide and outside of labs, as autotrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic growing conditions are all possible.In particular, we want to use Cas9 to promote the spread of genetic modifications across copies of the chloroplast genome and thus homoplasmy.Mesh filter in gun nozzle to prevent ruptured parafilm being fired into the target.The cutting would continue until the gRNA homology in all of genome copies has been disrupted, which can only result when the cassette-of-interest is used as the template for HR.A further challenge is the experimental cost - for example, chloroplasts can be reliably transformed almost exclusively by biolistic devices, and commercial biolistic devices are very expensive.The organisation of the two cassettes is shown in the figure below:After transformation, Cas9 would repeatedly cut chloroplast genome copies at the desired site of insertion, thereby promoting homologous recombination (HR).Base to provide stability for the gun and petri dishes of different sizes.By the end of the process, all genome copies would have the cassette-of-interest, i.e.Easily-replaceable supply of CO2, using generic threaded 16g CO2 cartridges Manual firing switch away from the actual gun, for safer firing.Our iGEM team has two solutions to this problem, one of which is the growth chamber.It is further hindered by the lack of standardised genetic parts available.Moreover, it may be possible (although further testing is still needing to confirm this) to get rid of the Cas9 gene altogether, by replating the cells onto antibiotic 1 only, once homoplasmy is confirmed.Contain all electrical connections and wiring within an insulated box, ensuring there are no exposed electrical connections to pose risk to the user.", "human_practice": "In order to integrate best practices for open hardware design within our protocols, we spoke to Tobias Wenzel, co-founder of DocuBricks; a website for high quality open source documentation, funded by the OpenPlant program...In order to best understand the requirements for our hardware, we contacted community labs from around the world to inform them about our project and find out the features they wanted to see in our designs and implemented them...", "modeling": "However, as their binding rates are likely to be small (particularly in early time periods such as those considered in our model, where there is still a multitude of on-target DNA sites which Cas9 is attracted to far more strongly), we were able to make the simplification of combining all of their action together into one differential equation, representing the average cleavage rate of a site with more than 1 mismatch in the first 8 PAM-proximal nucleotides.This results in a system of 92 ODEs (5 for Cas9:gRNA active complex formation, 84 for the cleavage/repair of each site with 0-1 mismatches in the first 8 PAM-proximal nucleotides, 1 for the average cleavage repair of the other 29 062 sites, and 2 for the evolution of Ntotal[on-target site] and NGOI), easily solvable by MATLAB\u0092s ode15s function.We solved this problem in the same way as the Salis lab \u0096 by calculating the average mismatch free energy for the C. reinhardtii genome using the given data set (yielding a value of 0.9039 kcal/mol), and simply using this value for ??GCas9:gRNA for all duplex mismatches, and a value of 0 for all duplex matches.88 740 target sites should yield 88 747 differential equations (5 for Cas9:gRNA active complex formation, 88 740 for the cleavage/repair of each site, and 2 for the evolution of Ntotal[on-target site] and NGOI).This is hopefully a more accurate estimation (having been calculated from peptide elongation and ribosome binding data) given that translational control in chloroplasts bears considerable similarity to its prokaryotic origins.Based on personal correspondence with Prof. Howard Salis suggesting that Cas9 is a very stable molecule, the Cas9 degradation rate was taken to be the same as the C. reinhardtii cell division rate (\u0093degradation by dilution\u0094), for which we used the fastest plausible C. reinhardtii cell division rate of 12 hours [11] (as a \"worst case scenario\" situation).Translation is mediated by factors in the 5\u0092 and 3\u0092 UTRs of C. reinhardtii chloroplasts, however, experiment shows that steady state protein levels for the atpA gene are invariant of mRNA levels, suggesting that only a small portion of mRNA is actually transcribed at any given time [12].Data exists on steady-state levels of VFP expressed under the atpA promoter (and associated UTRs) in C. reinhardtii chloroplasts [13], and we attempted to use this data, with the previously calculated degradation and transcription rates (VFP is also a highly stable protein in C. reinhardtii chloroplasts, likely to \u0093degrade by dilution\u0094), to work backwards and calculate the translation rate.The rate of degradation is considerably less than the rate of recombination [6], and so here we neglect it, leading to the following expression for a given target site: Ntarget[i] is the number of un-cleaved copies of the Cas9 binding site Ntotal[i] is the total number of both cleaved and un-cleaved copies of the binding site, such that Ntotal[i]-Ntarget[i] is the number of cleaved copies of the binding siteAs we are neglecting the possibility of degradation of the cut site, Ntotal[i] will be equal to the chloroplast\u0092s copy number, Ncopy, for all sites but the on-target site (i.e., the site which exactly matches the gRNA).The results were encouraging \u0096 even when the cut site used the gene of interest as its template for homology-directed repair a mere 10% of the time (with it using another genome copy the other 90% and reverting to its original form), the time to homoplasmy was only increased by 50 minutes (a 12% increase), with very little change in the homoplasmy time observed from about a 50-50 chance of template choice onwards.We next checked the effect of increasing the number of \u0093driver\u0094 and \u0093gene of interest\u0094 cassettes.In our proposed chloroplast transformation method, these are both expressed from the same \u0093driver\u0094 cassette, introduced into the chloroplast by a transformation method such as biolistic transformation with a gene gun, but under individual promoters (the psaA promoter for the gRNA, and atpA promoter for Cas9).However, if one of the cassettes does not enter the chloroplast at all, a homoplasmic transformation will never occur, so one of each plasmid represents a \u0093worst case scenario\u0094 situation for homoplasmy timescales in a cell which will eventually transform.As mentioned above, initial simulation used a parameter of 0.00027 min-1 for Cas9 translation rate, yielding an estimate of 36h15m for homoplasmy.It will only bind to the site if it \u0093recognises\u0094 the PAM \u0096 i.e., if the binding of Cas9 to the PAM is energetically favourable (notably, this does not require a perfect match).Once the site has been \u0093recognised\u0094, Cas9 moves down the genome, unwinding it nucleotide by nucleotide, displacing the complementary DNA strand, and allowing the gRNA to bind in its place (by Watson-Crick base pairing).All other parameters involving Cas9 formation were taken directly from the Salis Lab\u0092s paper, which were fitted from the results of in vitro Cas9 cleavage experiments in a cytoplasm-like buffer.All values from this section were taken directly from the paper by the Salis Lab, except for the volume of the C. reinhardtii chloroplast, which was taken to be 25\u00b5m3, half of the median Chlamydomanas cell volume of 50\u00b5m3 [15].The second should not be a problem either, as we can safely assume that while recombination in E. coli, as with C. reinhardtii, is in fact a second order reaction - dependent on both the number of broken sites, and the number of available repair templates - there will always only be one repair template (the sister chromosome), allowing it to appear as though it is a first order reaction.The model was implemented in MATLAB, due to its efficient functioning in solving systems of ordinary differential equations.We also neglected the second, as there is only evidence of small variations in supercoiling across the C. reinhardtii genome [4].The probability of the Cas9:gRNA complex binding to a potential DNA site is governed by a Boltzmann function, taking into account all of the potential Gibbs free energy ?Gtarget[i] is the free energy change associated with Cas9 binding to the ith potential siteIt follows that the rate of Cas9 binding to a given site is give as the rate of contact with the site (rRW) multiplied by the probability of binding.A further isomerisation reaction must then take place for this complex to become capable of cleavage.This process is modelled in the following 5 equations:NgRNA is the number of gRNA strands in a single chloroplast NCas9 mRNA is the number of mRNA strands coding for Cas9 in a single chloroplast NCas9 is the number of Cas9 molecules in a single chloroplast Nintermediate is the number of inactive, pre-isomerisation, Cas9:gRNA complexes in a single chloroplast NCas9:gRNA is the number of active Cas9:gRNA complexes in a single chloroplast Ndriver is the number of driver cassettes introduced into the chloroplast by a given transformation method The various k values represent first or second order rate constants rc[i] represents the cleavage rate of the ith target site on the chloroplast genomeOnce the Cas9:gRNA active complex has been formed, it is free to diffuse through the chloroplast until it finds a site on the genome.Thus, the equation for ??Gexchange for a 20 nucleotide gRNA is given byWhere dk is the weight of a mismatch k nucleotides from the PAM, and ??GgRNA:Cas9[k,k+1] is the free energy change from binding of the duplex formed by nucleotides at the kth and k+1th positions.A final energy consideration proposed by the Salis lab is that which results from the supercoiling which is induced by Cas9\u0092s binding to other, nearby sites.The Salis lab at Penn State University, however, have recently published a complete, biophysical model of CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage activity [1], which was a major point of reference for our modelling.For active Cas9 cleavage, a gRNA template must be transcribed, the Cas9 protein transcribed and translated, and a gRNA-Cas9 complex formed.The majority of gene regulation happens at the post-transcriptional level, with factors changing the shape of mRNA\u0092s 3\u0092 and 5\u0092 untranslated regions (UTRs) in response to a range of factors including light conditions, and nuclear signals indicating conditions such as the point in a C. reinhardtii cell\u0092s circadian rhythm [7].If the interaction is still energetically favourable once the R-loop has been formed along the full length of the gRNA, Cas9 will cause a double stranded break in the DNA, 3-4 base pairs from the PAM [1], and dissociate, losing its efficacy (as a single-turnover enzyme) [2].The kinetics used to model this process are very heavily influenced by the work of the Salis Lab, although similar work was done by the 2013 iGEM team from Wuhan University in China [3].biolistics), but will increase as more copies of the genome contain the gene of interest, following the expressionAs with all chloroplasts, regulation of gene expression in the C. reinhardtii chloroplast is a complex process.When Cas9 binds to a site, the uncoiling (negative supercoiling) of the genome which is necessary to form an R-loop is likely to further coil (positive supercoiling) all adjacent sites within a certain distance, as DNA\u0092s linking number is conserved.Around 4 hours in, the rate of transformation begins to tail off, as less on-target sites exist and the probability of being \u0093found\u0094 by Cas9 is lower.It could also be adapted not just to predict homoplasmy times in the chloroplasts of other organisms, but to yield useful information about the kinetics of Cas9-driven genetic transformation in any organism, encompassing the kinetics of: Cas9 cleavage on the chloroplast genome (for both on- and off-target sites) integration of the gene of interest, via homologous recombinationKinetic modelling of CRISPR/Cas9 action has been attempted by several iGEM teams in the past.We decided to just use the average mRNA half-life for C. reinhardtii chloroplasts, and then convert it to the same degradation rate for each chloroplast by the formulaHowever, no data on RNA half-lives in C. reinhardtii was found, so we used a value of t1/2 = 5.352 hours, taken by averaging the data for half-lives of several different RNA strands in Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts [10], leading to an average RNA degradation rate of 0.129hr-1.Cas9 translation rate was again very hard to parameterise without wet lab experiments.However, there is still a chance that it will dissociate from the site before it has the chance to cleave, leading to the equationWhere kc is the cleavage rate constant, and kd the dissociation rate constant.Once a site has been cleaved by Cas9, the site will either be repaired by homologous recombination, or its lack of stability will degrade this copy of the chloroplast genome until it is unable to be repaired.The number of \u0093gene of interest\u0094 cassettes inserted into the chloroplast had no effect at all on the timescales to homoplasmy, as the information on this cassette is rapidly duplicated during the transformation.Two issues about this parameter must be addressed \u0096 firstly, that it is a parameter for E. coli, and not C. reinhardtii, and secondly, that homologous recombination was modelled in the paper as a first order reaction, while we model it as a second order one.The literature seems to suggest that the first issue is not a problem.The script \u0093Cas9.m\u0094 reads in the C. reinhardtii genome from a text file, and generates a copy of the reverse strand of the genome.This can be simplified by assuming that there is 0 binding probability if ?Gtarget is greater than 0, however, this only narrows it down to 29 146 target sites \u0096 still too many for MATLAB to deal with in any reasonable amount of time.The final simplification in our model stems from the Salis lab\u0092s observation that 87% of significant Cas9 binding activity occurs at target sites with at most 1 mismatch in the first 8 nucleotides proximal to the PAM.In the C. reinhardtii chloroplast, there is no evidence of non-homologous end joining, and thus repair seems to happen exclusively through homologous recombination [5].This leads to the following equation to describe the rate of contact of the Cas9:gRNA complex with all possible sites on the genome: ? is the characteristic length between the site of Cas9:gRNA complex production and binding siteAs mentioned previously, Cas9 binding is governed by the sum of the free energy changes involved.For the circular, 203 828 base pair C. reinhardtii genome, this means scanning 407 656 different sites, yielding 88 740 potential binding sites.The script then calculates the free energy change which would be involved in Cas9\u0092s binding to all potential target sites.In response, cleavage rates of off-target sites increase, due to decreased competition, but quickly regain steady state levels due to the speed of homologous recombination.Plots of gRNA and Cas9 over time show the gRNA to be the limiting factor in Cas9:gRNA active complex formation, due to its higher degradation rate.Only 84 of the aforementioned 29 146 sites in the C. reinhardtii chloroplast genome meet this specification, and so we made the simplification of only considering these 84 sites (including the on-target site) with individual differential equations.However, due to the fact that most Cas9 binding will occur at a single site (the on-target site) in the regime we are considering, we were able to neglect the first effect.\u0093Improving recombinant protein production in the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast using vivid Verde Fluorescent Protein as a reporter\u0094.Another file, \u0093stopevent.m\u0094, allows the simulation to be ended when all copies of the chloroplast genome have been transformed.However, while the mRNA for Cas9 is expressed with the 3\u0092 and 5\u0092 UTRs for the atpA gene cluster, gRNA is not expressed with any UTRs for proper interaction with Cas9.Because of this, we instead used a value of 0.0057min-1, used by the 2014 Waterloo team for Cas9 production in Streptococcus aureus [14].that once the on-target site has been cut, there is 100% chance of it being repaired using the gene of interest, and once it is converted to containing the gene of interest (and the antibiotic resistance which is found on the same cassette), there is 0 probability of it being converted back.This would also allow us to validate several assumptions about the model.First, we checked the effect of the assumption of \u0093perfect selection pressure\u0094, by varying the percentage of the time in which the on-target site is transformed by homology-directed repair, rather than being repaired back to its original state.Only one site (shown on the graph in purple) \u0096 which has a free energy change of only around 1 kcal.mol-1 less than the on-target site \u0096 shows any significant activity at steady state.The Salis lab have already done sensitivity tests for their own model parameters, however, we thought it pertinent to check our own model\u0092s sensitivity to our own parameters.\u0093A 3  stem/loop structure of the Chlamydomonas chloroplast atpB gene regulates mRNA accumulation in vivo\u0094.\u0093DNA interrogation by the CRISPR RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9\u0094.Without experimental data to check our model against, we chose instead to measure how the model\u0092s expected time to homoplasmy varies with each parameter across one order of magnitude difference (centred around our final value), if all other parameters are held constant.For early time periods, the cleavage of the on-target site (which has around 7X higher probability of cleavage than the next most likely site) dwarfs all other sites, and untransformed genome copies tail off rapidly.This will initially be the number of \u0093gene of interest\u0094 cassettes inserted via the transformation method (e.g.The completed code can be found in the download link at the top of the page, including a sample file \u0093tests.m\u0094 for running the sensitivity analyses mentioned in the next section.Initial simulations were run assuming that precisely 1 copy of each cassette (the \u0093driver\u0094 and gene of interest) had been inserted into the chloroplast.In fact, the gene encoding the recA enzyme, which plays an enormous part in mediating homologous recombination, exhibits 53% similarity in E. coli and C. reinhardtii chloroplasts [17].From its site of production, the Cas9:gRNA complex can be taken to undergo molecular diffusion in the form of an isotropic, 3-dimensional random walk.However, many perfect matches had positive ??GCas9:gRNA values, and some mismatches had negative ones, leading to imperfect identification of the on-target site.Using a nucleic acid nearest neighbour model, this can be considered a weighted sum of the energy exchanges involved in binding each gRNA duplex to its corresponding DNA duplex.\u0093Evidence for Nuclear Control of the Expression of the atpA and atpB Chloroplast Genes in Chlamydomonas\u0094.\u0093Chlamydomonas chloroplasts can use short dispersed repeats and multiple pathways to repair a double-strand break in the genome\u0094.The number of plasmids inserted into the chloroplast will vary, and future teams may want to build on this section by describing the numbers of cassettes likely to enter the cell by various transformation methods probabilistically.The psaA promoter is used to express the 20 nucleotide gRNA + 455 nucleotide gRNA scaffold (for 475 nucleotides total), and the atpA promoter used to express the 4196 nucleotide Cas9 mRNA.The Cas9 and gRNA then diffuse randomly through the chloroplast until they encounter one another, at which point they form a Cas9:gRNA complex.\u0093Cell Volume and the Control of the Chlamydomonas Cell Cycle\u0094.Further complicating the matter is a reasonably noticeable lack of data on absolute gene expression levels in the C. reinhardtii chloroplast.After a considerable literature review, no absolute, dynamic data on mRNA levels in C. reinhardtii chloroplasts was found.Thus, our parameters are likely to only give rough, order of magnitude solutions.The transcription rates, katpA and kpsaA (for genes expressed under the atpA and psaA promoters respectively), are likely to be tied to be strongly tied to promoter strength.However, in lieu of any data on the strength of these two promoters, we used the simple order-of-magnitude transcription rate formula proposed by the NTU-Singapore iGEM team in 2008 [8]:This formula has been used by several iGEM teams since, with reasonable accuracy reflected in the results.Cas9:gRNA complex degradation rates was taken as the quicker of the gRNA and Cas9 degradation rates.Each mismatch between the gRNA and genome carries an energy penalty.Enough mismatches will make the interaction energetically unfavourable, causing Cas9 to dissociate from the genome and diffuse freely, until it finds another site.The form of the ODEs is set up in the \u0093CRISPRsim.m\u0094 file.Once Cas9 has bound, it may cause a double stranded break in the site, usually around 3 base pairs from the PAM.Homology-directed repair requires another, un-cleaved copy of the broken site, to act as a template for repair of the cleaved one.Cas9 uses no external energy source for binding, relying solely on the bound state being an energetically favourable configuration.This meant that the only way to accurately parameterise the gene expression portion of the model would be to perform wet lab experiments \u0096 however, our part library took sufficiently long to assemble to prohibit the running of these experiments in the allotted time.It then checks if all potential DNA sites on both the forward and reverse genome have a PAM which could bind to Cas9 in an energetically advantageous way (although Cas9\u0092s PAM is NGG, several other PAMs are still capable of binding Cas9).\u0093Direct measurement of transcription rates reveals multiple mechanisms for configuration of the Arabidopsis ambient temperature response\u0094.This is less than even C. reinhardtii\u0092s shortest possible cell division time, showing homoplasmy to be achievable in a single generation using Cas9.The aim of the modelling section was to create an integrated, kinetic model of our Cas9-guided chloroplast transformation mechanism.Cas9\u0092s diffusivity and characteristic length were estimated from its structure, while the other values were fitted from in vitro experiments in a cytoplasm-like buffer.Chloroplast copy number was held constant, at C. reinhardtii\u0092s average copy number of 80 [16].Plots of off-target sites over time show very few of them to be cleaved at any given time, due to the high probability of homology-directed repair.Discrepancies in the degree of supercoiling across the genome will result in a similar effect.However, for the on-target site, Ntotal[i] will steadily decrease, as these sites are converted to containing the gene of interest, and are no longer viable Cas9 binding sites.This leads to the expressionHere, NGOI is the number of copies of the gene of interest present in the chloroplast, with flanking homology regions.The only other relevant parameter in this section is the homologous recombination rate constant, kh.Encouragingly, the maximum plausible timescale for homoplasmy which results from parameter variation across two orders of magnitude is 1345 minutes (22.45 hours), still within a single day.However, here an issue was encountered with the ??GCas9:gRNA values which we were using.To the best of our knowledge, no past iGEM project has included a freely available, integrated model of Cas9-induced cleavage or homologous recombination.While the other sites may not have significant binding activity by themselves, the activities of all of them together are likely to make a noticeable impact on the system.Mol Cell Biol 15(6): 3003-11 We are a team of Cambridge undergraduates, competing for the plant synthetic biology prize in iGEM 2016.", "notebook": "In the first week we had lectures and discussion on synthetic biology, photosynthesis, DNA assembly and genetic engineering on plants.We need to test everything to know what went wrong, we plan controls for everything and design experiments which will teach us even if the result is negative.But we are still thinking far ahead and considering actually introducing some gene of interest by our finished system, if it works.We joined some keen designers as well as people with other backgrounds and together we were working in the lab, had an etnographic workshop, had interesting lectures and were looking for a common language.Entire team assembled for the first time in the Department of Plant Sciences.Lovely French students were were coming down to Cambridge to give us a workshop about connecting synthetic biology with design.Lots of brainstorming creates tonnes of ideas about ways to save the world using plants in 10 weeks.By the end of the week we have a long list of ideas but nothing too concrete so that we could assess feasibility.We spend a lot of time researching into edible vaccines and virus-like particles which could have an impact in the field and it s really exciting!In the afternoon we have established some strategic roles - who will manage the team, work on graphical design, wiki programming, content, etc.In the following days we discussed with the experts in the Plant Sciences Department and dived into the literature on chloroplast transformation.Alex has designed our logo and first flyers!Still swimming in the scientific literature and trying to get as much help from our busy advisors as possible.We discussed about the project, visited their laboratory and had a delightful lunch in the cafe.Last week we aimed for sending all the sequences for synthesis today.Various coffees and teas are available in the department, very planty.And we found a very exciting goal - to make a tool which would propagate our constructs into all the plastid DNA copies quickly and efficiently using CRISPR/Cas9.We have made a big progress in getting the team together, communicating biology to engineers, finding the common language.We got a lot of interesting inputs for our human practices and got to design a few human practices projects happening later.For example we want to make discussion workshops in between students interested in synthetic biology, philosophy and journalism to bring them together to share thoughts.We had a presentation from everybody about our ideas - Geoff about light-producing algae, Mie about environment cleaning and biohouses, Jake about growth facility, etc.Finding our biological direction: Homoplasmic transformation After a meeting with advisors we came to reconsider our idea of establishing a plant toolbox opening the Plant Track and especially chloroplasts to iGEM and science.Had some fun in building sticky note tower (the tallest one was 2.5 meters, built in one hour without previous preparation!)They are really keen to give us advice!", "protocol": "", "result": "The second set of homology regions were not linked to either the promoter or the terminator and thus we decided to clone into a L1 backbone (no appropriate section in level 0 parts) but the ligation did not work in

yielded were transformed into Chlamydomonas reinhardtii biolistically with the appropriate positive and negative controls.We have included \u0093failures\u0094 and \u0093mistakes\u0094 as we consider these to be useful to future iGEM teams who brave the challenge of working with plastids!Generated a library of parts for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplasts Verified these parts through sequencing and/or restriction digest Biolistically transformed Chlamydomonas with gene gun Library-based design of homoplasmy strategy for chloroplastsOutside the wetlab our work this summer has lead toWe have everything required to test our homoplasmy strategy: a comprehensive, well-documented design (after numerous discussions with professionals in the field), and a library of tested and highly modular Phytobrick parts.In the case of CAS9, which was additionally too large, we subdivided the sequence in 4 parts and through PCR added the necessary overhangs for a golden gate assembly without affecting the sequence.The design of parts included codon-optimization through the software programmedeveloped at Saul Purton lab for chloroplast genes as well as the removal of illegal restriction sites whilst maintaining the integrity of the coding sequence.Due to a misinterpretation of the novel phytobrick documentation we designed the incorrect overhangs and need to modify each part.This section only considers the biological wetlab work, please read about our library-based experimental design which we also consider a result of the summer\u0092s work with the aim of implementing a crispr-cas9 mechanism to achieve homoplasmy in a much quicker way, as necessary for this technology there are important biological containment considerations.Parts were mainly synthesized through iDT, however there were significant challenges.Firstly, chloroplast genomes have a high A/T content, therefore many could not be synthesized in this manner.However, we have yet to test its expression and toxicity in our chassis (despite planning the methods theoretically)With available parts we provide, establish positive strains for more complex experiments Apply and debug the homoplasmy acceleration strategy Optimization of protocols for transformation with our DIY gene gun Excited about the potential harnessed in plastid engineering to solve global challenges, we want to make this chassis accessible to future iGEM teams so that great ideas can be developed.To read more about this please refer to the demonstration page, as this aspect of the project served the purpose to demonstrate the potential of our modular parts to modify chloroplasts, not just of algae but of plants in general.Our wetlab results revolve around the achievement of the first C. reinhardtii chloroplast library in phytobrick standard which, among others, allows to creation of a modular transformation vector for chloroplasts (not previously available in the registry) and the necessary elements to use CRISPR/Cas9 technology.However, we were not able to establish a positive strain expressing a fluorescent protein We improved upon a previous iGEM part submission for cas9, by codon-optimising for Chlamydomonas chloroplasts and modifying to fit the Phytobrick standard, and submitted our part to the registry.Referring to the design of our CRISPR-cas9 project, we acknowledge the need to insert two genes simultaneously for experiments and so have cloned two sets of different homology regions, although only one set of them has been provided to the registry.We set ourselves the task of developing this plasmid for future teams and to make it modular by providing the homology regions as parts which can be assembled.This lead to many sessions of PCR troubleshooting, modulating and tweaking the variables and the PCR protocols to finally achieve all the parts in functional standard.Yet, for the verification of parts we required a functional plasmid to introduce the gene of interest (GOI), as transgenes are inserted into the chloroplast genome through homologous recombination and there was no available backbone with this purpose in the iGEM registry.When incorporated the part into the level 0 backbone and digested it newly and run on the gel, we saw that the first and second fragments were of the appropriate size but not the third, which was much smaller and we needed to repeat the PCR amplification.Further, our aadA gene was verified by bacterial transformation.This parallel cloning strategy was the safest way to proceed to achieve verifications.We verified our parts through sequencing data, indicated on the parts description (for example BBa_K2148001) as well as through restriction digest (for example BBa_K2148005).Restriction digest was important to verify the correct usage of the phytobrick syntax for cloning into the level 0 backbone.However, due to the size of the fragment we need to extract it in three parts to then assemble by golden gate cloning.The generation of the plasmid with our parts also served the purpose of proof of concept of the functionality and compatibility of our parts library.We decided on modifying some regions on the sequence (always making sure to maintain the encoded information) as well as yielded some parts from plasmids received from labs working on Chlamydomonas.TOP10 competent cells were able to grow on both ampicillin and spectinomycin plates(details shown in BBa_K2148001 part page).This is truly symbolic as it represents how chloroplast parts function in bacteriaExperimenting with synthetic biology in chloroplasts is the natural segue into higher plants, due to their bacterial ancestry.", "safety": "It was critical to ensure that we could integrate safe practices into both our project, and our working environment; and we achieved this using a wide variety of safety approaches and frameworks Safety by design was implemented in various parts of our project, in order to  design out  hazards that may pose a risk as a result of the project.We considered two methods of achieving this: by either placing cas9 outside of the homology regions (and the gene will be lost very quickly), or to design some gRNA to force the cas9 protein to destroy the cas9 genes - effectively a kill switch.As a very interdisciplinary team, Cambridge-JIC iGEM team members have a wide range of experience, but also come from different backgrounds when it comes to issues such as safety.This lowers the risk to the operator, and is considered a vital part of the device.The hazards posed by a growth facility are somewhat more subtle than the gene gun, but were nevertheless considered.This section will explore how we approached this implementation, with a particular emphasis on: Operator safety & Biological Containment The operating mechanism of a Gene Gun carries inherent risks, which were considered in the design stage.In order to combat this hazard, the gene gun was designed to operate between 100-140psi, avoiding, or at the very least mitigating against, this hazard.However, the risk of component failure and debris created by using pressurized air is not completely eliminated by design.This power supply was grounded, and thoroughly checked before connected to UK mains (low voltage AC - 230V)Successfully expressing cas9 in Chlamydomonas could lead to the creation of a  gene drive  -- that is, the modified organism would quickly go about propagating its DNA amongst a new population.Suitable training is necessary in order to ensure that every member of the team understands and appreciates safety procedures unique to the laboratory we were working in.Formal safety training included a brief by the laboratory manager, and further supervised  on the job  training was delivered by various staff to ensure that everyone was aware what safety procedures were required.Consequently, the growth facility does not increase the risk of biological release over conventional growth methods.Electricity presents a serious hazard to the operator.Simply, the strains grow on a gel within a petridish -- hence the containment is managed by the petri dish (which can of course be further sealed).", "keywords": "reinhardtii anthocyanin hypotaurine chloroplast examinations Chlamydomonas fluorescence chemoreceptors BabbleBricks electrochemical", "track": "Foundational Advance",

aims: Establishing systematic characterization tools to analyze the response of CHO cell to mechanical signals; Establishing engineered CHO cell lines with synthetic circuit containing mammalian mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel or transient receptor potential channel 5 (TRPC5), and quantitatively characterize the different mechanical response of the two cell lines; Developing platform for further improvement of the mechanical sensing ion channels with directed evolution.It is a iterative approach consists of 1) random mutate putative mechanical sensing domain of the TRPC5 channel proteins, 2) integrate single copy into the identical locus of CHO cells, 3) select CHO cells expressing TRPC5 mutant library with downstream NFAT promoter driven GFP expression.Demonic buzzing replaced the ambient sound I have been hearing for years.Despite this serious situation, hearing loss is still categorized as \"incurable\" for most of the patients.In addition to be used for engineering synthetic hearing cells for different sound, audiogenetics could also provide us with new synthetic biology tools, alternative to chemogenetics and optogenetics for research, due to its essential advantages, deep tissue penetration, temporal and submillimeter spatial resolution.While the mechanical part can be repaired by surgical processes, treatments for sensorineural hearing loss remain highly experimental and ineffective.After a lot of trial-and-error, we established three mechanical stimulation systems: hypoosmolarity shock with transient tunable osmotic pressure; tunable shear force with customized microfluidics chip; Piezo1-driven sound stimulation cell culture chamber with tunable frequency and amplitude.To our surprise, our data suggested that, they do sense different mechanical stress significantly differently.We d like to call the ensemble of the methodology as audiogenetics.MS channels open and close in response to various mechanical stress, which in turn allows for extracellular cations, such as calcium, to enter and depolarize the cell.To study all of these, we first stably integrate synthetic circuit including, tunable-expressing MS channels, genetic calcium sensor and calcium sensing gene expression cassette into CHO cell genome.\".Compared to recent accomplishments in engineering cells sensing light and chemicals, namely optogenetics and chemogenetics, there is little systematic research on engineering cells with capability of sensing sound.Other cells, such as blood vessel cells, could sense mechanical shear force.The downstream NFAT promoter report was validated with chronic sound stimulation of cells expressing Piezo1.The second question is that, can the wide type and engineered CHO cells sense mechanical stress differently?Hearing is an essential way for us to interact with the outside world.[3]The physical causes of hearing loss are complicated.It could also be used in cell replacement therapy such as modulating the physiology or gene expression of transplanted cells in vivo.?

mutants is also critical.[8]There are several general mechanisms for mechanical activation of an ion channel.The key objective of this study is to explore the possibility of using MS channels to sense sound instead.We could use following methods to induce calcium influx to quantitatively examine the function of R-GECO.Potassium ion is involved to make a depolarization and lead to the increases in cytosolic free calcium.After extracting cell\u0092s genome, we established a real-time qPCR strategy to identify cell clones with single copy Loxp inserted to genome.", "human_practice": "Also, we recommended SUV to collaborate with them and create more chances for SUSTecher to help people with hearing loss.Also, due to the considerable people who showed their interests to learn sign language during our investigation, we will propagandize sign language teaching on our social media constantly.Luckily, the Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talent Activities (IETA) was held in Shenzhen on Oct. 13-15th.We start to concentrate on those who have problems with hearing, not only limited to those with damaged hair cells in ear or other components of ear, but also all of the people with hearing loss in different extents.We designed a questionnaire on the Internet (link: sojump) to collect information about the understanding and care about hearing-impaired people, and to find a way that can help them in the most comprehensive and effective way.We have the necessity to make more people know synthetic biology and know iGEM, for these really change our world.To obtain more information about the life of people with hearing impairment, we consulted specialists who work in various areas, as well as some relevant local charity or official associations.In addition, for people who have suffered from these problems, we want to do something to improve their social acceptance and discover better resolutions for hearing loss treatment.We consulted several local charity associations about the issues they concern related to hearing-impaired population.It was said on their website that, Deaf Life is not only a way for more people to pay attention to the hearing-impaired group, but also to attract more hearing impaired people to express their own \"voice\", to display their own talent and highlights.Meanwhile, we included introduction about iGEM and the basic status of those people and we called for attention to care about them at the beginning of the questionnaire.To minimize the acquired hearing impairment caused by noise and electronic equipment, we also designed a brochure named \"Shape and Sound\".We hope people can devote to take part in research, charity or simple spread this idea, to make more people able to enjoy the sound.At the same time, he believes that though hearing aids and CIs are the most direct and efficient way currently, they cannot solve the problem of hearing loss thoroughly.In addition, we sent them our booklets introducing ear caring tips and calling on public awareness on hearing loss.He Yuhao chatted with the developer of Deaf Life APP.We sent our booklets to Deaf Life group and team member, He Yuhao, together with other SUSTech students, took a photo with the establisher of Deaf Life and the cartoon figure of Premier Li of China.At the beginning of our project, we set up our goal as sound visualization.At the same time, we introduced our project and received suggestions to promote our project.We are curious about laws that about the rights of people with hearing loss and the investigation process in case of surdomute criminal suspects.We called on ear caring and public awareness on hearing loss.We designed a questionnaire on the internet (link: sojump ) and investigated about whether people know about iGEM, and their experiences related to hearing-impaired people.In the 6-pages brochure, we introduced the mechanism of hearing forming and the status of hearing-impaired people around the world.Question 1: Have you ever communicated with hearing impaired people in your daily life?Despite the large amount of hearing-impaired people shown in the statistical data, fewer people have communicated with people with hearing loss.Shenzhen Ear Caring Plan: This organization provide hearing aids and Cis for child with hearing loss, aiming to let them go to school and receive education just the same as normal healthy child.We also cooperate with Southern University of Science and Technology Volunteer (SUV), a charity group organized by students in SUSTech.Hence, we printed booklets and also set up several public media accounts to make the public focus on things about hearing loss people including news, scientific education, welfare, etc.In the future, we plan to join these organizations and call for more people to participate.He mentioned that our project idea is good to solve the root of the problem.After consulting with otologist, we learnt some knowledge about treatment for hearing-loss people.For example, Two Cups of Water Sign Language set up courses every week in Shenzhen Center Book Store for people to learn simple sign language.We think the biggest problem of people with hearing loss is caused by communication difficult.Apart from those function and cost issues, CI is potential to lead to immune response and other problems for the body as an artificial equipment in a human\u0092s body.To deal with these problems, firstly, we believe that we should advocate people to protect their ears.He expressed his favor on entrepreneurships by people with hearing loss and also encouraged the public to care and support them.The exhibition of Deaf Life on Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talent Activities.The reason could be the lack of attention to hearing-impaired people, or the lack of sign language spreading itself.Further, it is the simplest way to make people with hearing loss feel comfortable in this society.The questionnaire also shows many people lack basic knowledge about hearing loss.Two Cups of Water Sign Language: They set up sign language class at Shenzhen Centre Book Store, one of the biggest book store in Shenzhen, to teach people for free.As a result, we pay attention to every opportunity that we can obtain to contact with people out of the lab.Pupil & middle school students in rural areas in ChinaIn summer 2016, some of our team members went to remote areas in Gansu and Sichuan Province in China for volunteer works.He stressed the importance of attention to hearing-impaired people, because this big problem has not been concerned enough as it deserved.Beyond hearing loss, pathologically caused hearing loss may also cause complications.Helping with hearing-impaired people could be the next thing they plan to do.After collecting and analyzing our questionnaires, we found that most people lack the experience of communicating with severe hearing-impaired people.Question 4: If sign language classes is added in general education as optional courses, would you like to learn some simple sign language?More than half of the people expressed their interests into sign language learning.Those surgical cure methods generally recover the structures in the ear for normal function, and hearing aids create the sound vibration with engineering methods.We called for concerns about them and also gave several tips for ear caring in daily life in order to reduce chronic hearing loss, which is popular nowadays but draws little attention actually for time course.Booklets \"Shape and Sound\" designed by ourselves independently.(before answering this questionnaire)Actually, because our questionnaire was spread to the public, half of people investigated have not heard about iGEM before.We also asked them to draw pictures of the ideal biology in their mind.Team member Zhenming Yu is describing Synthetic biology and iGEM to students in Liangshan, Sichuan.In Gansu, team member Ling Shaohua taught middle school students knowledge about iGEM and synthetic biology.Creative art works drawn by youngsters in Gansu,China, based on their understanding on synthetic biology.In summer 2016, high school students from different regions of China came to SUSTech Summer Camp.Your works are really amazing and I am deeply impressed.\u0094high school students  principal said.The lecture given by Dr. Wei Huang, Jiashun Xiao and Haiyan Wang, to high school students joining SUSTech Summer Camp.In addition to student population, we thought our project must be known by a wider range of people.Question 2: Do you know how to use sign language to communicate with people?We found that very few people can use sign language to communicate, even simplest words.If normal people can learn basic sign language, they can have more contact with hearing-impaired people and thus discrimination and prejudice on this population can be largely decreased.According to their person in charge, people with hearing loss account for 1/10 to 1/5 who participate in learning.The treatment for hearing loss involves reconstruction of the ability of each component.It is worth mentioning that two leader of their team are people suffering from hearing disability.All parts are important for the ability of hearing and any damage will result in hearing loss or disability.On the other hand, hearing aids and cochlear implants and clinical therapies need to be improved and pervaded.Question 3: Do you find it difficult to communicate with people with hearing difficulties?For those who have communicated with hearing-impaired people, about 80% feel it difficult.There are only 20,000 people can enjoy the ease brought by CI due to the high price.A deaf and dumb should be provided for with people familiar deaf and dumb gestures; A deaf and dumb with no defender should be provided with legal aid; Forcing disabled people to beg constitutes a crime; Utilizing and abetting the crime of persons with disabilities should be cracked down according to law, etc.The most efficient way to improve hearing so far is using hearing auxiliary equipment.1.1 Pupil & middle school students in rural areas in ChinaIn our Human Practices, we devote to raise people\u0092s awareness of deafness and let them involve in to serve our society.We focused on ear caring and called on public awareness on hearing loss.We gave out our booklets \"Shape and Sound\" in SUSTech.As a result, we need people to focus on this issue.We also expressed our interests and we hope to further our Human Practices after the Jamboree.In Shenzhen, they keep tight contact with community health center all over the city and they periodically organize health care for people with hearing impairment.More significantly, due to communication difficulties or discrimination, hearing loss may cause psychological problems.CI, together with hearing aids, bring sound to those who have never heard anything.The application, named Deaf Life, can help with real time communication for hearing-impaired people and thus improve living quality of them.We devoted to prepare a lecture for them, introducing our project based on their knowledge learnt from the biology classes set by their own school.[1] Also, we designed microfluidics and other stimulus to test our system.When we studied advanced knowledge about sound-sensitive channels, we consulted Dr. Zhiyi Wei majoring in Biochemistry& Structural Biology suggested that if we want to achieve better efficiency, we ought to use directed evolution methods to strengthen the sensitivity on protein level.? Mishra, R. C., Ghosh, R., & Bae, H., Plant acoustics: in the search of a sound mechanism for sound signaling in plants., J Exp Bot, Retrieved from http://www.pubfacts.com/detail/27342223/Plant-acoustics-in-the-search-of-a-sound-mechanism-for-sound-signaling-in-plants.As a matter of fact, the signal generated by CI is also different largely with natural cochlear.From the dimension of Policy, Law, Medication, Philanthropy and Research, we consulted lawyers and judges, doctors, professors and managers of several charity organizations.Given those suggestions, we read a paper about channels on plant cell membrane may take responsibility for their ability of sound sensing, which suggests the possible applications of our project.Actually, the normal function of ears is dependent on a system that realize amplification and subsequent transduction from sound wave to shear force.Outer ear is the entry of sound waves.Inner ear is responsible for the transduction of sound energy to electric signals.However, they showed great enthusiasm on learning more about them and caring them as possible.We contacted some charity organizations which regularly provide lectures and information for the public.We found that the sound receptor is the biggest problem for the construction of the whole system, while there is no direct receptor of sound on cell membrane.During our Human Practice consultation, one of the professors, Fangyi Chen, who studied on artificial cochlea gave us a hint about looking for mechanically gated channels in human ears.They have arranged activities to help people with visual disorder and their work is very impressive.For the most important part, CI is more than expensive for a normal family.",

entire time of our work to ensure thesafety and health of team members and lab workers alike.Since not all team members had experience in genetic engineering lab before, all of our team members have passed lab safety exam in our school.But even if the plasmids are transformed to other bacteria and translated, the proteins encoded in our plasmids are harmless, because the channels can only be activated in lab as natural sound and stress are much smaller than the threshold.The clean bench for cell experiments specially The bench is located in cell culture room, which requires thorough clean

ST123-JMY1212&mcfp3-JMY1212 mixed cells.With further comparison of the treated sand under a microscope, the quartz sand granules treated with Si-tag+MCFP3 cells were found to be tightly agglutinated, whereas the quartz sand granules treated with wild type cells remained dispersed.This result indicated that Si-tag+MCFP3 cells actually worked well at making silica particles form a certain intact structure, which fits our hypothesis and design of their cementation function.Quantification showing the different intensity of cylinders from the cementation of sand treated with different cells (quantification: n=3, t-test *: P&lt0.05).The cementation test verified the cooperation of immobilization system and flocculation system cells in actual application conditions.Compared to sand treated with wild-type cells, sand treated with Si-tag cells and MCFP3 cells was found to be cemented together tightly using microscopy.To find whether sand treated with different Si-tag cells can form cementation with different intensity, column cementation tests were also conducted with MCFP3 cells and different Si-tag cells.(d) Sand particles from the Si-tag and MCFP3 producing cell treated column were evaluated using microscopy and were found to be stuck together.LIP prepro + E. coli ribosomal protein L2 (1-60,203-273aa) + YLcwp3 FusionThe same as above, but different domain combinations of Si-tag show different cementation intensity.LIP prepro + E. coli ribosomal protein L2 (61-273aa) + YLcwp3 FusionThe same as above, but different domain combinations of Si-tag show different cementation intensity.LIP prepro + E. coli ribosomal protein L2 (1-273aa) + YLcwp3The same as above, but different domain combinations of Si-tag show different cementation intensity.LIP prepro + E. coli ribosomal protein L2 (1-60,GS linker,202-273aa) + YLcwp3The same as above, but different domain combinations of Si-tag show different cementation intensity.The sand treated with control wild-type JMY1212 cells was still scattered; only a few small clumps could be identified, and these may have been induced by the constitutive respiration of the wild type cells.For example, in desert sand consolidation treatment, this multi-porous structure will eliminate the potential compaction risk and will enable organisms to grow on it; in artificial reef construction on aqua farms, the multi-porous structure could also offer niches to all types of marine life.To mimic the real conditions in underwater applications, we also tested the sand cementation under the condition of high water-to-sand ratio with turbulence in flasks on a shaker.LIP2 prepro + E. coli ribosomal protein L2 (203-273aa) + YLcwp3 FusionThe same as above, but different domain combinations of Si-tag show different cementation intensity.LIP2 prepro + E. coli ribosomal protein L2 (1-202aa)+ YLcwp3 Fusion The same as above, but different domain combinations of Si-tag show different cementation intensity.Quartz sand (40 grams) mixed with either Si-tag+MCFP3 YMY1212 cells or control wild-type cells was loaded into a glass column, and a solution carrying oxygen, calcium and culture nutrients was supplied into the column using a peristaltic pump.(e) but sand particles from the wild type control JMY1212 cell treated column did not stick together.Fig 4: Sand cementation test with Si-tag and MCFP3 producing cells.(c) whereas sand treated with wild type control JMY1212 cells did not form cementation.However, with the treatment of Si-tag+MCFP3 cells, the sand aggregated, and an intact solid sand cylinder was obtained.It was also noticed in the cementation test that there were some small holes in the cemented sand cylinder.Sand treated with all Si-tag cells except wild-type control cells could form a cemented cylinder.It was noteworthy that BCA quantification of the total protein in concentrated cell culture suspensions showed that the engineered cells released a protein level 0.1 \u00b5g/\u00b5L higher than that of the control group.This finding is comparable to the results from the Si-tag silica binding test in which Si-tag1+2+3 cells provided the highest silica binding intensity while other cells provided medium or weak intensity.The Si-tag will be displayed on the cell wall to help immobilize the strain on the sands and then the secreted viscous protein Mcfp-3 will function as glue to bind sands together.(g) Sand treated with control cells in flasks on a shaker.After 24 hours of treatment, the sand columns were dehydrated in a drying oven and then removed from

poster session, but also designed fun activities to expand attendees\u0092 understanding and critical thinking of the development of synthetic biology and iGEM.It is just for fun but we should work hard, so that we can feel the happiness from within, during the process of the competition.And only with this kind of attitude, iGEMers could get down to doing some big issues that really make sense to synthetic biology or are able to solve real-world problems.So the products are not all of iGEM, iGEM is far from that.Moreover, as an important aspect in the biological research, the safety issue in genetically modified plant requires more consideration.However, this doesn\u0092t mean that we should give no thought on plant iGEM.Actually, some previous iGEM teams have done good job in plant.It gave us inspirations on changing perspective to our work both inside and outside the lab.And we mainly explored three questions about iGEM during the conference:With the rapid development of Synthetic Biology, it\u0092s definite that iGEM has become a multidisciplinary jamboree.So balancing the two aspects, is plant iGEM really possible?Firstly, its long growing time and higher standards for living environment make it conflict with annually held iGEM as we are always rushing in our preparation of the competition.Those activities included free debate about the better research method of synthetic biology, \u0093Quiz King\u0094 (synthetic biology Q&A competition), and iGEM life salon.It is worth mentioning that, before the conference, many attendees were under great pressure of doing experiment and other preparation for the Jamboree.It doesn\u0092t matter that you don\u0092t have relative knowledge or experience, because during training and studying, we will have some insight into our project and meanwhile, we will know more about Synthetic Biology, which makes learning more interesting and instructive.To attach more creativity and novelty to the project, it\u0092s important that senior team members need to lead and guide freshmen, providing them effective methods in proper time and preserving their possibility.Have you ever considered that well-designed biological stable-state can make your system work better?We can see from figure 1&2 that most of the teams(taking up 75%) whose projects are not related to bi-stable or tri-stable state of gene expression have ever considered to utilize a stable-state to optimize their project.With enough preparation and efforts, it can be possible.According to the discussion during HUST-Cheering conference, we found huge audience market of our gene expression toolkit.Therefore, no matter which field you\u0092re in, anybody interested in Synthetic Biology are welcome to participate in iGEM and it\u0092s sure that you can play a role in your iGEM trip.The most efficient way to development is gathering companions together to talk about the frontier of biology and nobody can stop the flight of our thoughts.And iGEM are the son of synthetic biology but it is growing up.And these two matters are crucial when we put our engineered strain into practice, because real-world conditions are more complex than lab, there will be factors to interrupt the input signal and gene product let along the background noise in the strain itself.We can learn a lot from the years in iGEM, helping us to optimize and do better in the next year.Appropriate inspection and supervision system is also essential for the accomplishment of the project because we are facing plenty of challenges.Being bothered by unsuitable promoter, what they also desire is the capability of toolkit to not only control gene expression to adapt to various inputs but also adjust threshold intensity of input to satisfy their requirements on different purposes.We have already create two versions of gene expression toolkit and we are heading to the next?Creating new control circuit could be a barrier.3.Have you ever been bothered with the problems on gene expression cotrolling ?If there is a tool that can solve these problems, what functions do you expect it to have?Most respondents (taking up 58.33%) thought that threshold adjustability is the most desirable features of such a tool.So here comes the second feature of our signal filter: we can set its threshold by adjusting different regulatory promoters and the amount of its interactive protein.The question is worth discussing.Firstly, we need to define what is iGEM and what is synthetic biology.During the conference, this pressure might even be deepened by listening to other teams\u0092 presentations.All the attendees were deeply moved by this idea and the true meaning of iGEM became clear to us.Please choose from the following:The result showed that all iGEMers taking the survey have ever been bothered by gene expression problems, among which lack of robustness is the problem most of them (taking up 62.5%) encounter.The valuable concepts in the research depend more on the capability of the professional faculties instead of students\u0092 scientific skills.Thirdly, at present, the experimental techniques in plants are behind those in other organisms.We should consider extending the participation cycle.Secondly, whether iGEM is suitable for the fundamental research in plants remains a question.On the other hand, teams can consider extending the participation cycle for a deeper research.And this system can press us to shoulder more and dedicate more and it\u0092s the guarantee for your acquisition and development.Expression leakage is the second problem (taking up 58.33%) they are worried about.Especially in the final part of iGEM life salon, Professor Chen Wenliang from team NCTU_Formosa shared his idea of \u0093enjoying science\u0094.If we can relieve iGEMers from constructing complex circuit, more and more people will easily join and create their own project to boom synthetic biology.Fast-response, Noise reduction and Stable-state enhancement take up 50% , ranking No.2 among all choices.Therefore, we concluded that what people exactly need was a tool to make their circuit more robust and stable in response to input signal fluctuations.Also, with a lot of mysteries remaining in the field of plant, its application in breeding, evolution and environmental protection is promising.After over four months\u0092 preparation, the conference was held on July 8th and 9th.But with the development of synthetic biology, we are facing more and more complex systems.This is not a simple competition but also a stage where gifted and creative students try to answer synthetic biology questions, raise interest in science and make friends who sing the same songs.This year, we successfully held the first \u0093iGEM HUST-Cheering!\u0094 conference.And just as team William and Marry did in 2015 they promoted low-noise promoter to deal with background noise in the strain.Please describe your problems on gene expression controlling and how do you solve these problems?On the sheet of answers toward this question, we could see various odd gene expression problems.But how many of the projects have been really put into practice and will some previous concepts be possible to achieve now?Even the advancement of experimental techniques can be a good direction in plant research.Therefore, plant synthetic biology deserves careful consideration but also a brave try.Considering the growth cycle, the possibility of genetic manipulation and other factors, plants like Arabidopsis thaliana and Physcomitrella patens may have advantage.These questions are mostly concerned from the outside.It has been a culture that students from different background chase for.Many difficulties can occur in plant research, such as long experimental cycle, low transformation efficiency, limitation of experimental conditions and so on.Not only biology but also chemistry, physics, computing science, engineering science and more are involved in iGEM.It helps students step into scientific world and shape their future.So what iGEM brings to us are somewhat depends on what we think of it and treat it.What we are trying to do is to decrease noise of signal input, in other words, filtering the input signal to guarantee stable gene product expression.4.We invited NCTU_FORMOSA, Nanjing-China, HAZU-China, NUDT-China, Jilin_China, ShanghaiTech_ChinaB and WHU-China to the conference.Therefore, we delivered a questionnaire to hundreds of iGEM teams around the world by means of e-mail and social networks.", "modeling": "Assuming that the other bacteria consistently produce lactic acid after absorbing lactose, our engineered bacteria are experiencing a pH transition due to lactic acid buildup (pH<7) and then began to secrete lactate dehydrogenase.(Lactic acid diffusion [without engineered bacteria])(Lactic acid final time concentration [with engineered bacteria])(Lactic acid final time concentration [without engineered bacteria])We can clearly see that lactate dehydrogenase produced by our engineering bacteria can effectively reduce the lactate concentration in the whole matrix through the comparison of the dynamic state and the final state.According to our summation of lactic acid concentration in the matrix, the engineered bacteria reduce the overall lactic acid concentration by 20% and could reduce irritation to the gastrointestinal tract.We want to see the change in lactose concentration over time in the matrix to see if our engineering bacteria can consume a significant amount of lactose and reduce lactose absorption by other flora.It is a pity that we have found that even if we adjust the lactose absorption rate of our engineered bacteria to a considerable value, we cannot prevent the spread of lactose, even the impact of the surrounding lactose concentration is not as large as we thought, which means that Our ability to compete for lactose is not strong, but if we increase the number of flora, it may cause other problems of the human body.We modeled a portion of the intestinal tract with a 20 x 20 x 20 three-dimensional matrix and used it to model the state of our engineered bacteria in the stomach.We hope that this part of the simulation model to test our loop in the treatment of lactose intolerance of the feasibility and make more improvements.Since our loop has a filtering effect, for the sake of convenience we will set the rate for most of the following models to constant.In order to make the model rigorous, we hypothesized the following prerequisites:- The total number of our Engineered bacteria and other bacteria is constant.No bacteria will be born or dead during the process.- The other substances in the intestinal tract have no effect on our engineered bacteria or it could be ignored.- The effect of gravity in the free diffusion process is negligible.- The squares that produce matter only spread outward.The PDEs (Partial Differential Equations) of this model are listed below.We use the difference method to find the approximate solution of this PDEs, and get the solution of the change of matrix concentration with time.It is concluded that our engineered bacteria can sense the lactose signals, it has great effect on inhibiting the increase of lactic acid concentration with secreted enzymes, which can relieve lactose intolerance to a certain extent.Secretory lactate dehydrogenase can break down lactic acid and reduce gastrointestinal irritation.We need to confirm the change in lactic acid concentration by diffusion model to determine whether our engineered bacteria play a corresponding role.Next we will analyze our results.Assuming that there is one engineered bacteria in each matrix, lactose flows through the matrix.", "notebook": "Placm-pRE-RBS-Cro-RBS-CII-TT-patp2-RBS-CI-TT-pR-RBS-CIII-psb1c3 EcoRI and XbalI", "protocol": "(Specific temperature according to different primers of components)",

eliminate the accumulation of expressed protein to interfere our measurement.To test its interaction with pR promoter, we constructed CI-TT-pR-RBS-GFPLVAssrAtag-PET-Duet-1 and take pR-RBS-GFPLVAssrAtag-PET-Duet-1 as control to test its inhibition function.As the Relative Fluorescent intensity measurement data shows, CI can inhibit pR in minor degree but the leakage expression under pR can\u0092t be ignored, so we should consider to increase the binding sites within pR or the amount of CI coding sequence in the circuit.Fig5: GFP fluorescence measurement over time

circuit increased over time and it showed significant difference from two control groups.From line chart and fluorescence detection, we can see that the test group contains cro expressed less GFP

protein than control group.Fig3: GFP fluorescence measurement over time gradient,excitation 485nm,emission 520nmAccording to the Flourescence measurement curve above, we can see clearly that GFP level increased over time and it showed significant difference from CK.We also did Fluorescence microscope detection after 30, 120 and 240 minutes induction.But we are confident to prove the high degradation efficiency of the tag as more than two thirds of the GFP degraded within 90 minutes which also offered an interesting and useful tool for rapidly down regulating certain target protein.We tested enzyme activity of our strain cultured at pH6.5, 7.5 and 8.5.We tested enzyme activity of our strain cultured at pH6.5, 7.5 and 8.5.Fig10: beta-galactosidase activity measurement after

LVAssrAtag degradation rate measurement under placIFrom the figure above, we are sorry to find that plac can not be prohibited from leakage, as there are nearly no difference between the test and

expressed directly for Bacteria II amplification, as known, quorum sensing is a system for stimulation(some signaling molecules called autoinducers) and response(receptor that will transcript certain genes) that is related to the bacterial concentration in the system.So, the mechanism and construction of CACCI can be divided into theChemotaxis Modification: to increase the bacterial mobility, modification based on E. coli chemotaxis related to the parts cheZ will be introduced into bacteria.Permeability Improvement: Because antibiotic substances contamination occurs in very low concentration, such as ~2000ng/L or 2ug/L that is much lower than normal contaminants concentration, accurate detection by bacteria using simple genetic circuit is very difficult.Chemotaxis consists of two situation, including positive chemotaxis and negative chemotaxis, which respectively demonstrates different behavior when the bacteria are exposed to surroundings with chemical molecules beneficial or harmful to their metabolism and reproduction.When absence of chemical, there is no molecules bind to the chemoreceptors, cheW, an intracellular protein, is associated with cheA and cheA will autophosphorylate itself and capture phosphate group from ATP.measure the nano distance, we need to adhere bacteria to a surface, the film we used isDuring our experiment , when elastic deformation--caused by the movement of the bacteria antibiotic concentration determination.Deformation caused by CACCI motility can be recognized with optical interference and the interference pattern recognition program inside NDM will analyze the deformation, thus antibiotic situation in sample canAntibiotics, or microbiotics, in narrow sense, are a various type of artificially constructed or naturally existing chemicals containing the capability of killing bacteria or inhibiting their growth, which are implemented widespread around the world.The overexpression of OprF in E. coli will drastically improve the antibiotic absorption capability, like antibiotic condensation occured in E. coli.Viroporins are similar to porins in which they oligomerize within the membrane to form pores and this oligomerization often occurs between hydrophobic, transmembrane and alpha-helical domains of the proteins.SCVE, SARS Caronavirus Envolope protein, is a kind of effective viroporin within 76 residues that is found normally pentamerized in bacteria.We hope one day, iGEM could not only share parts, but also share device, a nanomachine with mature functional system.Chemotaxis is a phenomenon of the movement of an organism, specific cells or bacteria, stimulated by chemical molecules.During engineered section, this structual part can directly import from iGEM parts and what we need to take care is the fragment complementary to efflux system gene.In order to produce slight deformation on the polymer film, we need to find a proper material to make it.Then, bacteria will still swim but not tumble.Because of lack of natural chemoreceptors for antibiotics, we need to construct a genetic circuit specifically to sense antibiotics, and according to the mechanism of chemotaxis, we need to overexpress cheZ to improve its phosphorylation capability on cheY.The resulting interference pattern that application, the two paths may be of different lengths or include optical materialsCooperating with the optical part, the electric circuit part makes use of a CCD camera to take pictures of interference fringe, and then our software in the Raspberry-Pi analysesThis is our design of hardware part.Figure 3 : The design of our hardware, looing from outsideThe Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a

mirrors, a 50% reflection - 50% transmission beam splitter (50%(R)/50%(T) in brief), a 80% reflection - 20% transmission beam splitter(10%(R)/90%(T) in brief).Thus, we transmembrane protein, or more specifically porin, and inhibition of efflux system Previous research from Sahar Melamed and Shimshon Belkin has already selected dozens of promoters responding to antibiotic concentration

endonuclease enzyme associated with the CRISPR segments derived naturally from Streptococcus pyogenes and other bacteria.To get more information on our adhesion assay, please refer to Results-Adhesion assayStrategy II: Covalent Adhesion between bacterial membrane and film with proper modification.To achieve covalently adhesion, we decided to implement the parts from 2014 iGEM TU_Eindhoven, and the whole system including these parts:DBCO-PEG4-NHS Ester (Dibenocyclooctyne-Polyethylene glycol-N-Hydroxysuccinimide), which covalently binding to polymer film.pAzF(p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine), a rare amino acid that would be implemented in bacterial transmembrane protein biosynthesis.In order to introduce pAzF into bacterial transmembrane protein, we need to mutate one of transmembrane protein, which is called COMPX.In order to make bacteria bind tightly, we provide two possible and promising solutions to figure it out, one of which is coating bacteria with polylysine(PLL) and the other is to chemically covalent bind between bacteria and polymer film.Polylysine refers to lysine homopolymers, whose precursor amino acid lysine is composed of two amino groups, one at the ?-carbon and one at the ?-carbon.Optical part is actually Michelson Interferometer, which can transform the shape change of a film into the change of interference fringe.In general, gRNA consists of 2 main parts, the former part is about 20 bp RNA sequences, which is exactly complementary to target genes, and it will be more impressive if these complementary sequence is at the beginning of the transcrption sites of gene.In general, gRNA consists of 2 main parts, the former part is about 20 bp RNA sequences, which is exactly complementary to target genes, and it will be more impressive if these complementary

of mechanism found in microbes responsible for many moving molecules, especially some toxic substances, microbiotics.According to previous researches, efflux system contributes a lot for bacterial antibiotic resistance, or multidrug resistance(MDR).The Young s Modulus of polypropylene is about 1.5Gpa, so it is selected as our candidate polymer film.Bacteria adhering to polymer film is one of the most important parts in CACCI.Implementation of SCVE in ROSE may potentially improve the permatilibty of small mechanism found in microbes responsible for many moving molecules, especially some toxic According to previous research, efflux system contributes a lot for bacterial antibiotic system has a physiological role of pumping out many bile acids, fatty acids to lower their intracelluar toxicty.Nonpolar residues face outward so as to interact with the nonpolar lipid membrane, whereas the polar residues face inwards into the proteins crossing a celluar membrane and act as a pore through which molecules are able in different situations for different molecules.Therefore, it is necessary to import an exogenous porin with higher effiency of small molecular tranportation, such as OprF derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.OprF represents one of the largest pore sizes on bacterial outer membranes, allowing diffusion of polysaccharides in a range of 2000 to 3000 Da.\"Breadboard\"

manipulated, for example conversion into a digital value.Theoretically, when elastic deformation--caused by the movement of the bacteria containing cheZ parts--occurred on the film, interference will be observed.Consequently, CACCI is also established with systematic permeability reconstruction to increase its capability on molecules absoprtion.Adhesion: According to our modeling, we need to adhere bacteria to a surface.Using Michelson Interferometer, the optical part, Spring transforms the shape change of CACCI s membrane into the change of interference fringe.As for bacteria, naturally, chemoreceptors were expressed on the bacteria membrane, which enables the bacteria to  sense  the existence of chemical molecule concentration in the surroundings.Therefore, it is necessary to import

system, please refer to Notebook-Protocol-Adhesion PreparationOMPx is a integral outer membrane protein X from Escherichia coli, belonging to a family of highly conserved bacterial protein that promote bacterial adhesion to and entry into mammalian cells.According to our modeling, see more in Modeling-Film Candidate, pressure caused by adhesive bacteria is about 10^-4 Pa. Consequently, the wavelength of laser about 650nm is able to detect um-scale deformation.Natually, CRISPR/Cas9 system is an important immune system that is able to resist the existence and reproduction of exogenous genetic materials, directly recognizing and then cut these genetic fragments, such as phages and plasmids, by CRISPR spacers, which is quite similar to RNA interference(RNAi) discovered in eukaryotic organisms.In order to completely inhibit the major efflux system of E. coli in genetic level, CRISPR would be an impressive solution for totally deletion of the function of efflux system.Clutersted reularly interspacaed short palindromic repeats, abbreviated as CRISPR, are some fragements in prokayotic DNA with short repeats.And the latter part is a secondary structure part which finally forms as hairpin used to recruit Cas9.And the latter part is a secondary structure part which finally forms as hairpin used to recruit Cas9.Cas9, which is associated with the CRISPR segments derived naturally from * Streptococcus pyogenes* and other bacteria.CRISPR/Cas system is an important immune system that is able to resist the existence and reproduction of exogenous genetic materials, directly recognizing and then cut these genetic fragments, such as phages and plasmids, by CRISPR spacers, which is quite similar to RNA interference(RNAi) discovered in eukaryotic organisms.Consequently, ROSE is established with both genetically amplified circuit andIn general, ROSE as a community, containing two kinds of bacteria, among which Bacteria I specifically receives antibiotic concentration information from antibiotic substance expression regulator by quorum sensing, whose information is provided with positive amplification for Bacteria II.Nonpolar residues face outward so as to interact with the nonpolar lipid membrane, whereas the polar residues face inwards into the center of the beta barrel to interact with the aqueous channel.Porins are beta barrel proteins crossing a celluar membrane and act as a pore through which molecules are able to diffuse.Nowadays, with proper modification, CRIPSR/Cas9 has become a common gene editing tool, being able to cut the target gene with gRNA design.When it comes to artificial design of CRISPR/Cas9 system, how to sucessfully achieve recruitment of Cas9 depended on the structure of gRNA.CACCI depends on Spring.Actually, SPRING is a measurement system which is designed to detect antibiotics in natural water bodies.In order to would be an impressive solution for totally deletion of the function of efflux system.The signaling signaling molecule will be produced in the cytoplasm using LuxI synthase enzyme and N-(3-oxohexanol)-homoserine lactone begins diffusing back into cells or other bacteria, threshold concentration, about 10ug/mL.Consequently, we name our main body of device, SPRING, we hope with the assistance of our SPRING, we are able to share and enjoy those clean river, likeThe Michelson interferometer is common configuration for optical interferometry and was invented by Albert Abraham Michelson.There was a time when antibiotics, alongAntibiotic substances containing several mechanism, rendering them to kill and inhibitOrdered formal course of treatment, these antibiotic would effectively treatgonorrhea,However, treating with microbiotics may be associated with a rang of side effects, from some mild including gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea to severe like hearing loss, kidney concentration utilization of antibiotics alter the host microbiota, especially theThe production of antibiotics in pharmaceutical companies explosively expanded these years.Besides, the discovery of NDM-1(New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase)Though, antimicrobial resistance can be transferred through evolutionary theory, main contribution of increasing antibiotic resistance comes from individuals  inappropriate antibiotics treatment, overuse of antibiotics without prescription from professionalDemonstrably, attribution of antibiotic resistance not only from clinically, but from agriculture and animal husbandry.As planned, OMPx will be mutated at residue 16, from glycine to p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine, zooming in the mutated site in orange:Consequently, the model of adhesion goes like this: modified bacteria containing special p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine transformed tRNA carry OMPx with mutated p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine site.In the 1970s the solderless breadboard (AKA plugboard, a terminal array board) became available and nowadays the term \"breadboard\" is commonly used to refer to these.It would be an attemptation to go directly reverse to antibiotic resistance,which is to inhibit the function of efflux system.3.Package: In order to let everyone use the integrated improvement bacteria, CACCI in a more convenient way, we will provide CACCI in powder.Because antibiotic substances contamination occurs in very low concentration, such as ~2000ng/L or 2ug/L that is much lower than normal contaminants concentration, accurate detection by bacteria using simple genetic circuit.When it comes to artificial design of CRISPR/Cas9 system, how to sucessfully achieve recruitment of Cas9 depends on the structure of gRNA.The antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains physiologically improved of their cell bodies or genetically enhanced capacity of mutagenesis and geneBecause of such horizontal genetic exchange, nowadays, efficacy loss may attribute to the emergence of many antimicrobrial-resistent strains.The head of the drill can be replaced by many part such as saws or polish-head.Oh, all parts should be fixed with hot-melt adhesive (hot glue), in order to maintain stability.In farms or hospitals, solution containing ecological equilibrium of bactierial colonies and sidelong threaten public health.Because individuals neglecting antibiotic emission, rivers in China now encounter substances for human(48%) and animal(52%) in 2013, which is tenfold usage of USA and antibiotic substances in high concentration can be detected from many river basins that evaluation, antibiotics can be detected in all rivers in China in different degree.As figure-1 shows, the system SPRING includes Optical part, Hardware part and Software part.Finally, target gene such as LuxlCDABE will be engineer Bacteria I to release quorum sensing molecules to Bacteria II for exponentiallyTo achieve antibiotic concentration corresponding to AHL production, AHL produced by Bacteria I will be regulated by antibiotic substance sensing promoters.In general, bacteria tumble in the absence of chemical.When presence of chemicals, cheA is free from cheW interaction, and cheZ will efficiently remove phosphate group from cheY.He helps CACCI in three aspects, which are the optical aspect, the hardware aspect and the software aspect.Besides, these proteins as well play an important role in the resistance against attack by human complement system.As a result,It is notable that this second level amplification module won t directly expand the signal intensity, in another way, it will indirectly enlarge the resolution of different antibiotic concentration gradients.In NDM, there is a system for measurement: CACCI which contains chemotaxis modified bacterial adhered to a polymer membrane.The former one is regulated by Lux complex and produces cI inhibition protein and the latter one will be inhibited by cI protein and EGFP will be expressed when lack of cI protein.Consequently, this genetic amplification circuit, compare with others, will not directly enhance the intensity of GFP expression but toThe design intention on bacterial membrane permeability improvement is directly from part of mechanism of antibiotics resistance.For example, in E. coli, AcrAB efflux system has a physiological role of pumping out many bile acids, fatty acids to lower their intracelluar toxicty.It would be an attemptation to go directly reverse to antibiotic resistance, that is to inhibit the function of efflux system.The model is illustrated as following:Our CACCI construction is systematically not only including chemotaxis modification, but containing some permeability improvement by inhibition of efflux system and overexpression of exogenous porin.Theoretically, bacteria won t receive antibiotic substance because of mutation of its transmembrane protein and efflux system.Besides, using traditional genetically modified circuits to express report is still time-consuming, comparing with generalConsequently, we originally established CACCI based on chemotaxis and interference to make a larger level of antibiotic molecule detection, even a detection for other chemical molecules.Among these rivers, the Pearl River Basin in South China and Hai River Basin in North substances were discovered in these rivers, one of them, for example, in the Pearl River Basin, amoxicillin was found at 3384 ng/L and fluprofen at 2867 ng/L.Although, antibiotics in the river samples, its feature is also deficiency: that is such strong specificity may hurt extensive measurement.Artificial synthesis of sulfonamides, quinolones and oxazolidinones enrich theAs the matter of fact, microbiotics, the great saver of our life, is now putting us inEmergence of antimicrobial resistance is theoretically predictable by evolutionary potential.When the recognition result turns to yes, Cas9 will cleave the foreign DNA.When the recognition result turns to yes, Cas9 will cleave the foreign DNA.Plus considering cm squared film, we need the Young s Modulus of the film is less than 1GPa.(Attention: the LB liquid medium should contain glycerol which is used for cryopreservation.At last, the software analyses them and transmits the results to PC.However, facing that large scale contamination, complicated routine and trained personnel cannot be satisfied at all districts, so do it in many developing and undevelopedAlong with ROSE, CACCI embedded in SPRING will be used to detect antibiotic.These maximal induction of each promoter strain is tested in the course of 10h ofThe mechanism of these promoters are different from each other.Mechanism of cleavage is to unwind the foreign DNA and check whether there is a about 20 bp fragments that is complementary to guide RNA (gRNA, in brief).Mechanism of cleavage is to unwind the foreign DNA and check whether there is a about 20 bp fragments which is complementary to guide RNA (gRNA, in brief).This phenomenon is based on the interaction between the positively charged polymer and negatively charged cells or proteins.Since the discovery of penicillin by British biologists Alexander Flaming in 1929, the antibiotic family has been enlarged a lot.In China, the overuse of antibiotics for animal is the same serious as the clinical therapy.Spring s hardware, based on Raspberry\u0096Pi, allows spring to take photos or videos of the fringe.Though lack of standard ranking on antibiotic contamination, according to environmental scientistsNow, many technology including ELISA, Delvotest, HPLC-MS/MS, CE and Quantum Dot are able to detect antibiotic concentration in river sample, however much of their have muchNot portable, many big and automatic equipment are indispensable for concentrationComplicated Routine, which requires trained personnel to conduct experiment.The overexpression of OprF they oligomerize within the membrane to form pores and this oligomerization often occursSCVE, SARS Caronavirus Envolope protein, is a kind of effective viroporin within 76 residues that is found normally pentamerized in bacteria.CCDs move charge between capacitive bins in the device, with the shift allowing for the transferThe Michelson interferometer is common configuration for optical interferometry and was invented by Albert Abraham Michelson.Our theoretical modeling also illustrate a higherOur ROSE construction is systematically not only include quorum sensing and logic amplification, but containing some permeability improvement by inhibition of efflux system and overexpression of exogenous porin.This is achieved by \"shifting\" the signals between stages within the device one at a time.Later, phosphate will be transferred to cheY and the phosphorylated cheY associates with the flagella motors making flagellum rotates clockwise.During engineered section, this structual part can directly import from iGEM parts and what we need to 3.MicF: An Antisense RNA Gene Involved in Response of Escherichia coli to GlobalTherefore, we USTC develop a device NDM with an optical interference path, recognition program based on RasberryPi and Arduino to detect antibiotics in natural water bodies.Based on a Raspberry-Pi, hardware part can take photos or videos of interference fringe, then our software analyses them or transmits to your PC.With treatment of IPTG, LuxR will be constitutively expressed to ensure LuxR-AHL complex willIn addition of signal amplification through quorum sensing, an artificial genetically engineered cascade magnification circuit is also implemented in ROSE construction.In this cascade signal circuit, LuxR-AHL complex trigger the activation of promoter Lux, then express cI derived from ? phage.As for E. coli, a gram-negative bacterium, whose surface is formed by lipopolysaccharides(LPP), which is negatively charged at physiological pH.", "design": "", "human_practice": "We hope kids can possess a memory about the mechanism in biological world and the seed sowed by us can prosper in the future.Finally, a panel session was beginning: This session is for students and adults to know iGEM, establishment and history of our team built in 2007 and the future of synthetic biology and biological technology.This is the beginning of our integrated human practice in April.Survey on the civic awareness of the use, pollution and governance of antibiotics in China: This is a main human practice activity closely related to our project.They all hoped these incredible jobs would make more contribution to our human being, environment and the earth.In April 27th to 28th, a theme activity called Saving earth, saving water was established in University of Science and Technology of China.We saw their perfect work in necklaces, and we also enjoyed their smiles during the activity.After people had saw the tiny bacteria and DNA in a large scale, it was time for them to know about a latest track of biology\u0097synthetic biology, and iGEM, the most important platform for youths to know and develop syhbio.With the explanations by the leader of our team, kids began to know the basic principles of synthetic biology.We iGEM team, cooperating with Encoding Life Association (ELA), Natural Conservancy organized promotion and introduction to the public.At the beginning, our host briefly introduced the situation we human-being encountering in China.We hope our human practice would deliver the public fresh ideas on scientific researches as well as build a communication bridge between public need and the frontier of science.The first two things about biology coming up in people\u0092s minds must be bacteria and DNA.I do not know much about synthetic biology, I think it might undermine the law of natural evolution.USTC: Probably, ethics is a very important issue, let\u0092s take the X-Men for it, I think if there is a group of people with specific abilities in the world, maybe the order will be destroyed.As is often the case that the boss is out of sight, people can only notice the tiny part of the pollution while the primary is obscured\u0097because people can never believe that certain antibiotics, sulfamonomethoxine, for example, used on the animals in their plates can be a hundred times more than that on themselves.The data show that only 1% of people know the concrete condition, and the rest 99% of people are only guessing or even totally unaware of the consumption of antibiotics of China.So we can see that people know a little about the dangerous resistance via media, but their concept about this severe problem is still vague.In regard to the techniques to detect antibiotics in water, people seem to be blind, let alone the difficulties we meet in the specific detection of the types and the concentration of the antibiotics.They are not only curious about make their own genome necklace, but felt cool on the mechanism of DNA introduced by our members.Then, our team members briefly introduced iGEM and our projects to the audience.It is pretty good to share our gains and losses with them and enlighten the kids who are interested in science.Then, the leader held a small class for the kids: we exquisitely prepared a presentation specifically for kids to introduce to them the basic knowledge of DNA and genetic engineering with simple words and lovely pictures.Nearly half of the people hold an optimistic attitude on the antibiotics residue in food and drinking water.When asked about the source of the pollution, more than 80% believe that the major blame of the antibiotics residual should be hospitals, but in fact, the usage on human is only 16%, while on veterinary, 84%.General biotechnology and previous iGEM projects on water cleaning are included in the lecture, as well as our draft ideas about nanomachines detecting trace antibiotics in water.USTC: That is actually molecular biology did not play a significant role in animal protection?sNC?I certainly believe that molecular biology and ecology are closely connected, but generally speaking, science develops focusing on the needs of society, for example, pharmaceuticals.The activity finally attracted hundreds of people joining us, which made such big contribution to evoke public cognition on water and other environmental issues.Survey on the civic awareness of the use, pollution and administrating of antibioticsAntibiotics are widely used on both human and animal in order to defense the illness caused by bacteria.Saving water, a lecture for iGEM: An introduction of the situation of waste and contamination of water around the world nowadays to the public.Leader of USTC, Juntao Yu introduced the basic molecular biology mechanism and iGEM to high school students who were deeply intrigued in biology.The leader firstly introduced the daily laboratory apparatus to the kids and students such as centrifuge, vibrator, PCR Instrument, high pressure steam sterilization pot, incubator and etc.We still believe few can influence many with their constructive suggestions and going into action so that one day people in China, even all over the world, will go forward with science shoulder by shoulder.CineCom, movie community of University of Science and Technology of China, is interested in communication with our iGEM team.We tried our best to eliminate the gap between the fast developing science and puzzled people even if we finally managed to influence few.We hope our work will make a great contribution to letting more people know iGEM, synthetic biology, and believe the fact that we benefits a lot from genetic engineering technology already!It indicates that a number of people neglect the side effect that the abuse of antibiotics may cause.More than 95% of them know that antibiotics can cause antibiotics resistance.Thus, further publicity is needed.According to the last part of the questionnaire, although few of them have heard of synthetic biology, they are positive about biological techniques in detecting antibiotics.We gathered data about people\u0092s awareness of the issues of antibiotics contamination in China.In our human practice section, we combined general biology, molecular engineering and synthetic biology with public health, policies, art, movies, education, environment and society.In fact, the superheroes are human beings with specific features, perhaps one day, synthetic biology can realize the superhero story.So this is not an individual can decide, but will reach a uniform height in the future.sNC?For eco-propaganda, public misunderstanding about it is just like the one about genetic engineering.These are some applications of the techniques, but not science researches.And in 2013, China even consumed half of the antibiotics in the world.This year iGEM, along with ELA, delivered an integrated human practice (IHP) activities for the public.As for the species under the threats of human destruction, humans should not look for ways to protect them just to cover up their bad damage to them.We are surprised to know that children are aware of the word DNA, while they hardly understand the essence of it.CineCom: I think nowadays science fiction superhero plays the main theme of the majority of these movies because such script does not need too deep excavation, but only gorgeous special effects, which can gain substantial box office.Can we preserve the genomes of the extinct species and use them to culture new ones?We explained the mechanism of some of them and we were glad to see some middle school students caring about the working mechanism of centrifuge.In April 14th, we USTC iGEM along with our supervised Encoding Life Association (ELA) held a lecture on water cleaning technology based on common physical and chemical technology as well as some biological engineered technology.So we continued teaching them more about the physic theories in it.For the endangered species, if they cannot adapt to the natural changes, humans cannot help them, either.The abuse of antibiotics is the ringleader because it causes antibiotic resistance.CineCom: From the perspective of evolution, the evolution of our abilities is to meet the real needs.Maybe next time we could try on our epithelial cells!A lecture on general molecular biology, synthetic biology and iGEM was held in August.USTC: Yes, but haven\u0092t the superheroes started to tiring us?People judge things based on subjective preferences of decision, and therefore does not comply with the laws of nature.Nowadays, the unsupervised discharge of antibiotics arouses a big concern about their negative impacts on ecosystem and human health.For example, at paramecium stage, we can only engulf and divide; until the evolution of adult classes, we have the ability to build and engineer.We iGEM team established a club in our university called Encoding Life Association (ELA), especially for science education for children in China.Synthetic biology, a new method, promising it is, we believe it will have wonderful application in solving antibiotics pollution.This year, we continued developing our online account in Facebook and Weibo.Children wrote down their dreams on our broad, some of whom proudly promised that they would join in iGEM, were they admitted to university one day!In order to make our audience better enjoy these galleries, activities, we designed dozens of questions.This activity firstly sent fundamental knowledge and mechanism of DNA extraction for the attenders.sNC: With the reduction of wetlands, and the destruction of the habitats of the migratory birds, the birds are facing unprecedented pressure to survive, not only birds, many other species\u0092 extinction rate is higher than last century.USTC: Certainly.Since recently the public in China is concerned about GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms) severely, we want to directly and briefly introduce to them the genetic engineering technology and let them judge whether the GMO is safe for our daily requires with our guidance.Now, we invited their leader Mr. ChungKim Whang.sNC: The main activities of natural conservancy of USTC are bird observing and cradling.Consequently, there is great necessity to make the crowd acknowledge of the proper usage of antibiotics.Isn t it fun and cool?Attempting to attract more contemporary and children on synthetic biology, we built an activity called Come and extract the genome of strawberries with our kitchen materials.Then they started extracting DNA from strawberries according to the protocol we had prepared.sNC?Molecular biological researches on genes provide us with a better reference of classification and explanations of the reasons for extinction from the microscopic point of view.Cross Talk: Now we are expanding our connection from the public to the professionals.Putting it into tiny bottles as the pendants of the necklaces.One of a sci-freak major in organic chemistry in USTC laughed in those following words,That was incredibly amazing!This survey is really important in the promotion of antibiotic pollution and antibiotic resistance.How fast do the birds extinct around the world?However, the improvement in medical conditions extend humans life span and promote humans well-being.So there are lots of collaborations in the progress of filming and screening.For example, the black hole in Interstellar and the theory of clone in Orphan Black?I think this is precisely the potential threat of the \"super heroes\".According to our project, we held a water saving activity and launch a questionnaire survey.But only very few of them care and get to know about whether the pollution of antibiotics approaches to our environment and our daily life.We do not pay enough attention to the treatment of animals suffering from the disease, because generally it seems to follow the laws of nature, sick and old animals should be eaten by predators, so that evolution goes forward.Many people said, taking part in this activity made them better and deeper understand the magnificent work that synthetic biology could achieve.During this lecture, our team member introduced some intriguing methods that provided by previous iGEM teams, including genetically modified phytoremediation of TU-Munich 2013 iGEM team and biological replacement of heavy metal ion contamination in water.A brief introduction of iGEM: A general introduction of iGEM and synthetic biology lecture for high school students.We usually start from the child, giving lectures in primary schools.And we found those children quite imaginative on synbio, neural science and molecular biology.Our simple interpretation on our chemotaxis and interference approach is so fascinating that many adults strongly changed their perspective on genetically engineered bacteria and molecular biology.So, we provided the opportunities for people, especially kids, to get access to megascopic bacteria and DNA, which are usually invisible, just as they are called as microorganism and molecules.", "modeling": "Consider in a current area S, the density of bacteria on surface is ?, and during a interval dt, the change of bacteria density is d?(Sdsigma =K_{a}\times (1-frac{sigma }{sigma _{0}})\times dN-K_{d}\times Ssigma dt)Where Ka is the adhesive rate of each hit, Kd is the drop rate of the adhered bacteria.Then, after solving this Ordinary Differentiate Equation, ODE, we got the equation shown below,(sigma (t)=frac{K_{a}CV_{z}sigma _{0}}{KCV_{z}+K_{a}sigma _{0}}\times (1-e^{-frac{K_{a}CV_{z}+K_{d}sigma _{0}}{sigma _{0}}\times t}))According to this result, the density of bacteria at time t is related to adhesive rate of bacteria Ka, concentration of bacteria c and velocity of bacteria Vz.And we can let (frac{K_{a}CV_{z}}{K_{d}sigma _{0}+K_{a}CV_{z}}) equals an integrative constant, K. In addition, we cannot start recording the image data the moment we put the bacteria on the cover glass in reality, so there should be a time delay in our modeling.Also give some irreplaceable constructive opinions and key indicators on the operation of detecting the concentration of antibiotics.Vz: Average swiming speed component in the z axis, which is perpendicular to S.(m/s)and irrespective of contacting with each other when swimming, we are able to conclude bacterial movement is free.(V_{z}=int_{0}^{frac{pi }{2}}V\times cos\theta \times frac{dS}{S}=int_{0}^{frac{pi }{2}}frac{V}{2}cos\theta sin\theta d\theta =frac{V}{4})Consider during the interval dt, in area dS, there are dN bacteria in tiny volume (dS \times V_{z}dt) hitting the wall whose area is S. Schematic image illustrates the process mentioned above,Because the number of bacteria in solution is much more larger than it on the glass surface whose area is S. So the concentration of bacteria (C) can be regarded as steady during the measurement period.Assuming the number of hitting wall bacteria is stable, the surface can only adhere one layer of bacteria, that is the place which has already adhered bacteria can not stick any more bacteria.Results are delivered below:It is interesting that we could know the \"Initiation moment\" through our data analysis, which is very cool.Another intriguing and important property we got through our data analysis is the adhesion ability(Bacteria to Cover Glass)(AA-B-CS in brief).According to the fitting results and modeling equation, the derivative of the fitting function at the beginning(t0) is the bacteria number growth rate in its maximum.Assuming the rate of stick (P) is constant, the movement percentage of bacteria will present in an exponential form changing through time.According to the fitting results shown above and equations, we could get some useful information when operating NDM, such as,Because we can not start recording the image data the moment we put the bacteria solution on the cover glass, so there is a starting time delay in the equation.After solving these equations above, we ultimately get the Young modulus of material required G <1GPa in order to get ~um order deformation.Therefore, we selected several materials as possible films: low pressure polyethylene, rubbers, and glass as our material of the film.Just think about it, if every bacteria pull together, we can detect the deformation even the film is made of steel and even bigger than steel.This part introduces the data of adhesion experiment, makes exploration and interpretation on bacteria adhesion dynamics.According to the simulation result, when  m  reach 95% of its maximum or minimum value(frac{K}{K+k}), t~100s.Consequently, we recommend user to get the results in NDM, you should wait approximately 100s after putting film into optical path.This part explains the fundamental principle of our detecting method - interference.This explains why we emphasize both bacteria and film material when we defined this parameter.Note: The bacteria solution in  HCB1-PLL(+)-0  sample was not the same with other samples, so the AA-B-CS value is much different with other s.Surprisingly, we found that the concentration of antibiotics doesn t effect the AA-B-CS in our assay, which suggests that we are able to use the same type of bacteria treated with antibiotic in different concentrations, which is another important theoretical base of our NDM.Through the pre-test and data in paper, we use 20ug/ml poly-L-lysine coating the film over 4 hours or overnight at the temperature 4? eventualy.Because the motility of bacteria will decrease when we do not administrate antibiotics.We got the best interaction time is the moment when the number of movement bacteria reach the maximum value.Thus we highly recommend the Bacteria-film intraction time(Ti) is approximately 100s after treating with bacteria solution, which means since you inoculate the bacteria about 100s, you should put the film into your sample solution and determine its antibiotics concentration.In test \"PAO1-PLL-0\", the bacteria solution was culture overnight in 37?(which means the bacteria was in platform stage).One thing need to know is that the different clip we implement in our pre-experiment will get different fringes.In the pre-experiment1 (you can read protocol of our pre-experiment in annex showed below).In the pre-experiment2 (you can read protocol of our pre-experiment in annex showed below).As the deformation range(h) is much more smaller than the radius(r) of the film (h<<r),Because the area of CCD camera is relatively small, whose size is ~cm x cm, the interference pattern is approximately paraxial spherical as well.Ideally, light path sketch should be as follows.Thus we got the accurate equation depicting the density of bacteria time t as,(sigma (t)=Ksigma _{0}\times (1-e^{-frac{K_{a}CV_{z}}{Ksigma _{0}}\times (t-t_{0})}))In order to fit the data conveniently, we change the equation form into a more general one,This program is used to calculate the amount of bacteria and get the percentage of moving bacteria, which is essential for our further research.As the deformation range(h) is much more smaller than the radius(r) of the film(h<where f is the resultant force of the bacteria, F is the tensile force in the film, h is the deformation distance, r is the radius of the film,?r is the variation of the radius, which is r, d is the thickness of the film, G is the Young Modulus.The thickness(d) of film is 0.16mm.Then, we are able to get Young Modulus, a critical physical parameters to depicting the characteristic of film candidates.Assume that 1% of bacteria are push ahead statistically, then the additional pressure given by bacteria is (Delta P=0.01 \times sigma F_{0}).Assume the radius of film is r, deformation range equals h.The film is subject to several forces acting, including force f given by bacteria and tensile force F through the film.Let s get some approximation on this model.Assume the driving force of the movement of single bacteria is (F_{0}) in horizontal plain.Where f1 means the resistant force bacteria containing in water solution, k is a constant called drag coefficient at this conditions.Besides, in the gravitational field, if we consider bacteria dragged by gravity in solution, then the static equation is revised as below, Where rho represents the density of solution, V indicates the extra volume of liquid immersed with bacteria, g means the acceleration of gravity.Then, in accordance with the data in previous research, the speed of bacterial movement(((V_{1}))) is approximately ~10(mu m)/s, while the speed of bacterial sedimentation(((V_{2}))) ~(mu m)/s.And considering the size of single bacterium, assume bacteria as cylinder, whose diameter equals 0.5um and length is 1~3(mu m).This part starts with the bacteria movement ability, analyze the interaction between bacteria and the special film, and obtain the requests of the material properties eventually.The interaction between bacteria and film is essential for our work.(Light shown in blue line is the reflected light from holophote, light shown in red line is the reflected light from film).However, in reality, because the virtual image of holophote and the film can not be set strict parallel in actual situation, the light path sketch becomes like below, where light shown in blue line is the reflected light from holophote, light shown in red line is the reflected light from film.We could use the method of coordinate transformation to simplify them as follows, where light shown in blue line is the reflected light from holophote, light shown in red line is the reflected light from film.where r is the radius of the film, h is the deformation length of the film, a is the length of each side of the CCD camera, ? is the slip angle between the film and the holophote which we estimate.Using these parameters, we simulated the interference fringes image as following,How amazing our model is !More details on our coding using Matlab please refer to 2015 USTC in Github.Calculate a self-adapting or special threshold value in the image binay progress.Now we got the theoretical bacteria density variation formula and an efficient program to demonstrate the real number of bacteria on film.Simulational result just hit the row image we got before!Consider the reflect surface was not strictly parallel with the CCD, and the angle between the surface and x/y axis is ?/?.So we can know the optical path differences and light intensity distribution on CCD areUse matlab to simulate the interference pattern, and the result showed as following, When bacteria pushing the film and making film deform, the angle between film and axis will change.diluted bacteria solution 50 times.If we want to observe the deformation of the film, the bacterial additional pressure on film should reach a stable stage.Solving these equations, we are able to get Young Modulus, a critical physical parameters to depicting the characteristic of film candidates.The film is shown in black edge and the clip that used to fix the film presents in green edge.Through the modeling of bacteria adhesion, we can get some characteristics important but difficult to directly measure on bacteria adhesion and reaction to antibiotics.Calculating with all data, consequently, we concluded that driving force of bacteria is (10^{-13} N) by solving the equations.Firstly, let s check the geometric size of our special film I.So we defined this derivative value as the adhesion ability of the bacteria solution to cover glass, or call it AA-B-CS for short.This equation told us AA-B-CS relates to Ka, the adhesion rate of bacteria on every hit, C, the concentration of bacteria solution, Vz, the average swim speed of the bacteria.Because of the same interaction between solution and bacteria, in gravitational field, bacteria share the same k with the horizontal movement constant.Assume the motor ability of each bacteria does not change.The thickness(d) of film is 0.1mm.Assume the numerical density(?) of bacteria is ~(1000 /mm^{2}), which means a single bacteria occupying the area of approximately ~100 (sim 100 mu m^2).The wavelength of

are conducting biological experiment or not.This lecture is really important for a professional expert to conduct experiment not only following basic and regular rules but also protecting themselves.Our team members designedly studied The Regulations of Agriculture Genetically Modified Organisms Safety as well as The Regulations of Pathogenic microbial laboratory biosafety, in order to check whether we meet relevant local and national safety standards and offer biosafety training to every member in the wet-lab.Meanwhile, to keep us safe from hazardous chemicals and organisms, personal protective equipment, such as gloves, respirators and lab coats, were required during the experiment.Before the experiments started, we fully prepared for the biosafety in lab.When conducting experiments and assemble NDM, level A should be satisfied always.Class B: In level B, personnel should not only wear lab coat, but wear nitrile gloves or latex gloves, which are necessary when touching bacteria solution.Even all the parts have been proved no harm to the public usage, we still take genetic safety into consideration.Microorganism auxiliary to the device (CACCI) is genetically engineered E.coli, carrying micF, SoxS, Cas9, CheZ and OprF.This procedure is the first step for detection.Class C: Level C is the standard protocol for personnels when drilling.Even leaked to the environment, they are not competitive enough to survive and threaten the environment and public health.This protection guide is especially for people who are interested in making NDM their own or who will use NDM for material detection.Microorganism will be conglutinated to the film and then encapsulated.And please do remember ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES to prevent possible hurts and DO NOT WEAR GLOVES because it is not convenient when drilling.Class D: This is the most complicated protective measure for spraing painting procedure.This year, none of the new parts will raise safety issues for further applications in the current knowledge.During all the experimental period, the regulations were obeyed.P. aeruginosa is classified to BL2 so special attentions were paid to the relevant experiments.Please pay attention to personal safety when doing experiment:Class A: Fundamental protective measure when producing NDM and conducting experiment.One should wear lab coats, along with goggles, masks and gloves to toally protect oneself considering extreme pungent odor volatilizing when painting.To prevent possible hurt, those safety methods are defined by ourselves.When you are

scaffold holding these enzymes in place, the import of substrate and export of product would be bypassed, and therefore the efficiency of a certain enzymatic process could be increased or facilitated.With the scaffold it is possible to recreate or engineer diverse multi-step processes with high efficiency.To affirm this presumption, we decided to build a metabolic pathway that could be easily measurable and in which the scaffold\u0092s contribution to its efficiency could be readily measurable.We prototyped the alcohol-to-carboxylic-acid pathway, which was thought to transform ethanol into acetic acid through a two-step mechanism.Due to its high potential for further engineering, we believe the scaffold to be a very important advancement in the biotechnology landscape.We believe the scaffold to have many serious implications, since it may tackle many different issues such as customizing and facilitating the creation of synthetic metabolic pathways, and the processing of substrates in industrial processes.For many metabolic processes happening in the cell, the enzymatic substrate must be imported into the cytoplasm for processing.This feature alone will have a huge impact on the engineering of processes, since artificial metabolic pathways can be tailored for specific needs, and then displayed on the scaffold for diverse industrial and research purposes.Imitating the naturally occurring process of enzyme channeling, emulating multi-enzyme complexes and programming seemingly complex metabolic processes are only some of the many possible advantages of the scaffold.Many proteins that have potential scientific or industrial interest are difficult or impossible to express in prokaryotic organisms in a useful manner.Eukaryotic enzymes could be expressed in some other organisms, like yeast, and displayed extracellularly on the bacterial scaffold, giving a whole new toolkit to researchers and companies alike.We believe that one of the strongest points about the scaffold is its ability to harbor proteins in an ordered fashion.The efficiency of the pathway would be readily measurable by assaying the production of the pathway\u0092s final product, acetic acid.", "design": "", "human_practice": "Given the frequency of such freezing temperatures in Canada, investing in the creation of other organisms with this gene could be a significant boon to the economy.Probably the most important thing to keep in mind when considering the public\u0092s perception of GMOs and synthetic biology, is that any ethical concerns regarding the behaviour of corporations that manufacture and sell genetically modified crops ought to be viewed as separate from unfounded fears of unnatural genes.Additionally, the Canadian government requires labeling \u0093if there is a health or safety issue with a food\u0094 such as the presence of an allergen, whether or not the food was genetically engineered (Health Canada, 2012).Additionally, Canada currently has regulations in place, stating that any genetically modified organism destined for human consumption must undergo rigorous testing for a period of 7 to 10 years before being allowed on the market (Health Canada, 2012).In fact, it is important to note that Canada is currently \u0093the third largest producer of genetically modified organisms in the world\u0094, according to Environment Canada (2011).Although it is possible that genetically modifying a crop could produce an unintended effect, such a problem would become evident during the aforementioned 7 to 10 year testing period (Health Canada, 2012).In light of the differing opinions surrounding genetically modified food, it is important to be aware of Canada\u0092s current policies regarding the issue.Given the sometimes negative public perception, a company would be unlikely to want to announce that their food is genetically modified, and would likely take steps to source their crops differently, or avoid selling their product in the area which mandated labeling.As such, it is important to judge the safety of a product rationally, based on facts, rather than preconceived notions regarding whether or not it is \u0093natural\u0094.Based on the present state of the issue, it is important for the Canadian government to continue to support sensible and evidence-based policy making.Based on this, it can be said that Canada has maintained a sensible policy regarding GMOs, one which must be maintained in the face of present controversy.As with virtually any new technology, the driving force behind the development and introduction of GMOs has been their potential benefits, economic and environmental.As such, it is important to continue to be sensible when instituting new policies, or risk unexpected problems.Based on this, it would appear that the best course of action is to maintain current GMO\u0096related policies, and to continue to enact policies based on evidence, when necessary.A genetically modified organism, or GMO, is defined as any organism that has had its genes altered by humans through genetic engineering (Health Canada, 2012).Such critics also argue that GMOs are not akin to an extension of plant breeding, as genes are often borrowed from unrelated species, sometimes with unpredictable effects, such as the creation of deformed pigs (Smith, 2003).Many of these fears are based solely on the fact that GMOs have had their DNA altered by humans, and are therefore \u0093unnatural Frankenfoods\u0094 (Smith, 2003).As our project is ultimately envisioned as a consumable product, it is extremely important to properly manage public perception of the safety of GMOs.Research released by the American EPA has also shown that glyphosate, the herbicide used on such crops, is non-toxic to humans, even in doses equivalent to a lifetime of eating exclusively from sources sprayed with the herbicide (\"Glyphosate,\" 1993).While these are certainly examples of unethical corporate behaviour, when used to criticize the science of synthetic biology, they primarily serve to distract from the real issues by pointing fingers at an obvious target.Perhaps the greatest obstacle to the development and cultivation of genetically modified crops has been the fear that they are unsafe.One of the most well-known genetically modified organisms is the variety of strawberry that contains a gene for resistance to sub-zero temperatures (Fumanto, 2003, p.197).On the surface, this would appear to be reasonable, as it would simply indicate which food items contained genetically engineered ingredients.One of the main arguments raised in defense of genetically engineered crops has, in recent years, been the possibility of creating grains with higher levels of vitamins and minerals, to help curb nutritional deficiencies in a population.One of the main considerations that occurred to our team was the public perception of GMOs, and their connection to synthetic biology.Historically, people have often been apprehensive of the idea of genetically modified organisms, particularly when destined for human use or consumption.At present, GMOs can legally be developed, grown, and sold within this country (Health Canada, 2012).The most apparent of these is the existence of the often-discussed glyphosate-resistant, or \u0093Roundup Ready\u0094, crops (Tunniliffe, 2011, p.27).It is also interesting to note that altering an organism\u0092s DNA without the use of breeding had occurred long before the advent of genetic engineering.It is true that the results of genetic engineering can sometimes be unexpected, but the same is true of any field of science.In fact, the genes from this barley are still present in the environment, having caused no great harm to other species.Likewise, it is important to continue to enforce rigorous testing requirements for any genetically engineered food destined for consumption.Seeds of deception: Exposing industry and government lies about the safety of genetically engineered foods you re eating.Additionally, it is without a doubt important to continue to enforce stringent testing protocols, in order to verify that each genetically modified crop is entirely safe, on a case-by-case basis.This form of criticism, while not specifically directed at the science of synthetic biology, often casts a broad net, associating anything involved with genetic modification with the unethical behaviour of corporations.They have also been thoroughly tested and deemed safe through the process dictated by Environment Canada.Genetically modified foods are likely to become more common as time progresses, and it is important not to fear them irrationally.This was done, the barley was cultivated and sold, and there was no public outcry.Synthetic biology is currently one of the most exciting and active areas of research within the life sciences.Aside from crops designated for export to regions where nutritional deficiencies are common, there would appear to be little reason for Canada to pursue the cultivation of rice engineered to contain more vitamin A, as Canadians usually have access to diets providing the necessary nutrients.Although there is nothing inherently unsafe about GMOs, it is important to judge each product on an individual, case-by-case basis.For example, there was recently an effort in California to introduce mandatory labeling for all GMOs sold in stores (Dahl, 2012).", "modeling": "", "notebook": "Finally,

cooling stops.Loomino is a simple DNA synthesizer that is built using open-source software and hardware.The issue is that it lacks the ability to pump air, and thus we would encounter large amounts of

were negative controls and demonstrate that no residual EtBr was present in the absence of DNA bonded to the glass.Figure 1 shows that EtBr localized in the regions where DNA was added to the slides.This indicates that there is at least some DNA present on these slides after the wash.It is possible to state that this is the the newly ligated oligonucleotide, a combination of both the 52mer and the 23mer.It is unclear whether or not the DNA washed off or just the EtBr.To recap, the RNA Ligation is an important step our system because it provides mean for PCR amplification of the newly assembled oligonucleotide.As a control, the second type of reaction is between a 52mer and a 43mer without any extra phosphate(This was done to also show that an extra phosphate was necessary for the ligation of both oligos).Figure 2 shows 4 different glass slides that underwent a wash step similar to the ones that would be done by the loomino device.Then, appropriate primers and PCR elements are added to the reaction chamber to amplify this newly formed sequence of DNA.The bottom two slides show slight orange fluorescence highlighted by the black boxes superimposed on the image.On each slide, the number of oranges circles corresponds to the number and location of the regions DNA was added to.Samples were sent out for sequencing to confirm that the proper sequences were present in the

"Additionally, since introducing a new gene to a wild population could have unforeseen consequences for the population and for the ecosystem, we also looked into a recovery drive, which spreads through a population the same way as a gene drive does, but that reverses the effects of the gene drive Several years ago a powerful new tool called CRISPR was discovered.First it needs a mutated copy of the affected protein such that the gene drive s gRNA can no longer bind to that region thus preventing the gene drive from progressing and second, Cas9 and a new gRNA sequence need to be present.In addition to these considerations, there are bioethical concerns about genetically modifying an individual organism much less an entire species.Scientists have no proposed way to stop or counteract the effects of a gene drive should something unexpected occur.Our proposed solution is a recovery drive.A recovery drive is a gene drive with the intention of erasing the effect of the initial gene drive.Using a gene drive to alter the corresponding gene on the other chromosome, we can cause 100% of a transfected individual s offspring to inherit the gene of interest.Now a instead of being used for microbial immunity, a new function has been proposed for this system: inducing a gene drive.Because most of the fears are about the lack of control over the direction of the gene drive, our goal was to model an inducible one so that we could have greater control over the recovery process.There are several criteria for a gene drive to occur.The gRNA target sequence needs to bind to something exclusively found in the gene drive and not found in the recovery drive.Our goal was to model an inducible recovery drive to reverse the effects of a constitutive gene drive.A gene drive is when one gene copies itself and overwrites the other copies on the homologous chromosomes.The preeminent target of all the talk about gene drives are the mosquitos as they are a host for many human pathogens and they fit the above requirements.The species of interest must sexually reproduce, have more than one copy of that chromosomes, and reproduce at a relatively high frequency so that the gene penetrates the population in a reasonable amount of time.This helps a gene to propagate through a population much more quickly, which, in the case of curbing disease spread, could be life-saving.However, with traditional Mendelian inheritance, only 50% of the offspring of a transfected individual will inherit the gene of interest.With the advent of CRISPR/Cas, gene drives are no longer an idea but rather a reality.That is why we decided to make a gene drive.Because the other copy chromosome is intact, the cell undergoes homologous recombination using the other copy as a template thus the copy with CRISPR/Cas overwrites the wild type copy.", "design": "The gene drive serves to knock-out the yeast ADE2 gene, and the recovery drive, upon activation via tetracycline exposure, replaces this gene with a mutated ADE2 gene, called ADE2*, which is has the same protein sequence as the original ADE2 gene using different codons to prevent the gene drive from targeting ADE* The work was to be done in the yeast strain CEN.PK2, an auxotrophic strain that is unable to produce tryptophan, uracil, leucine, or histidine.The design for the first gene drive appears as follows: This DNA complex contains the proper prefix and suffix sequences to function as a BioBrick.The second URA3 promoter was added so that we could flip the URA3.The design for the second gene drive, or recovery drive, appears as: The biobrick prefix and suffix as well as the 500 bp upstream and downstream were included for the same reasons as in the gene drive.The ADE2* gene codes for the same protein as the wild type ADE2 gene using different codons to prevent the gene drive from targeting ADE2* and overwriting the recovery drive.We refer to these as the gene drive and the recovery drive.(http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/11/5365.long) In this way, we have control over when the effects of the first gene drive are reverted.The SNR52 promoter, structural crRNA, and ADE2 gRNA targeting sequence were replicated from the DiCarlo 2015 paper (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4675690/).500 bp upstream and downstream of ADE2 was added to make sure that the ADE2 promoter was incorporated as well as so that it can easily inserted the yeast genome via homologous recombination.", "human_practice": "This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the

"result": "Initially, we saw little success in our efforts to PCR amplify the DNA components of our gene drive complexes.Then, on a population of mutant-type yeast that resulted from the gene drive, the recovery drive would be activated and its effects would be observed.Eventually, we succeeded in this task, and saw an early success in combining the various components into their respective gene drive complexes.Future work on this subject could involve experimenting with different promoters for the recovery drive.After the necessary gene drives were created, our plan was to modify our yeast with both drives using homologous recombination.We were able to clone one part of our recovery drive, a yeast codon optimized TetR.When that was achieved, the first gene drive would be observed in action.", "safety": "In our experiment, this change back to wild type is phenotypic in nature, as the underlying modified gene is no longer the same as the wild type; it is a nearly identical gene with the same effect, except that it is immune to being changed by the original gene drive.Because gene drives are designed to spread throughout a population, care was also taken that modified yeast did not leave the lab.Waste contaminated with these organisms, whether they were modified by our experiments or not, was placed in a sealed bag and put through an autoclave so that it was sterilized.Essentially, a recovery drive is another gene drive that returns a modified population back to wild type.To ensure safety, a mask was worn to protect the face and eyes from the UV light.Considering that it was not necessary to use pathogens or many toxic substances in our work, we focused on minimizing risk to both us and those around us.In a broader sense, our experiment itself was focused on biological safety.In addition to EtBr, our work with gel electrophoresis involved the use of potentially dangerous UV radiation.A gene drive is a powerful tool for modifying an entire wild population with little necessary human interference.Therefore, gloves were used when working with modified yeast, and disposed of in waste that was subsequently steam-sterilized.This waste did not leave the lab until it was sealed in order to ensure no contamination occurred.Our work also made extensive use of ethidium bromide (EtBr) to view DNA in our gel electrophoresis experiments.While yeast was mainly chosen for technical reasons described previously, it also was an attractive choice because it is not particularly dangerous to work with.Safety is a major priority

"background": "", "description": "This collection, which we have dubbed the \u0093Circuit Control Toolbox,\u0094 consists of a suite of parts which can be added to the end of a given genetic circuit; each part provides a specific and independently tunable response which allows direct control over the ultimate output behavior of the circuit.The overall input/output behavior of any genetic circuit can be represented by a graph known as a transfer function, which relates concentration of input molecule to output protein expression.Apply the appropriate Toolbox parts to the end of your circuit, and express your original final output protein at the end of the series of Toolbox components.In this manner, future iGEM teams and synthetic biologists will be able to easily obtain higher levels of precision and control over the behavior of their genetic networks.1.This limitation highlights the need for genetic devices that can modify the behavior of arbitrary genetic circuits; implementing these devices would enable precise behavioral control that is invariant to the constraints of the constituent genes that make up the circuit [1].By implementing and adjusting multiple tools to the desired degree, a diverse range of circuit output behaviors can be achieved, generating a plethora of unique transfer function responses.The implementation of this Toolbox relies on its generalizability and consistency over any arbitrary genetic circuit.The addition of RiboJ as an insulator justifies the application of Toolbox components to the end of any genetic circuit, irrespective of its choice of final output protein [4].Our Circuit Control Toolbox can easily be implemented in any project concerned with the behavior of genetic circuitry by working through the following sequence of events:1.This modification is accompanied by a shift in the threshold of the circuit\u0092s transfer function.The Synthetic Enhancer Suite exploits a synthetically modified enhancer/promoter system engineered to allow genetic circuits to generate multi-state responses.The progression from synthesizing parts into a circuit on a plasmid, to transformation and testing in vivo, is a lengthy and expensive process which furthermore is largely variable in terms of actual functionality of the final product [2].Inherent constraints to behavior based on the nature of a circuit\u0092s constituent genes.Likewise, any modifications to the circuit affecting input/output behavior can be visualized by a transformation of the transfer function representing the circuit.However, the field remains fundamentally limited by the magnitude and specificity of behavioral control over genetic circuits and circuit networks.The Circuit Control Toolbox consists of three distinct tools which prompt unique behavioral changes to the circuit\u0092s output relative to its input, and therefore generate different transformations of the circuit\u0092s original transfer function.The success of any genetic circuit relies on the ability to precisely tune a response to a range of input concentrations; it would therefore be desirable to obtain a reliable method for tuning circuit response, ideally without the need to redesign the core of the circuit.The other foundational limitation of genetic circuit construction addresses the inefficiency and unpredictability of the design and construction process itself.This ribozyme part, known as RiboJ, insulates a circuit\u0092s promoter activity from the genetic context of the coding sequence, allowing for consistency in the levels of relative expression across multiple coding sequence insertions.This tool effectively allows for scaled changes in the magnitude of a circuit\u0092s output response, thus adjusting the amplitude of the transfer function.The Decoy Binding Array tool implements molecular titration to tune the circuit\u0092s sensitivity to input concentrations.A circuit\u0092s relative output behavior may be influenced by the coding sequence for the output which it controls.Swap out the final protein coding sequence in the original circuit with a Ribo-J insulated repressor sequence that is compatible with the Toolbox.4.When constructing a circuit with some intended behavior, design is limited by the available input-specific regulators to gene expression and their characteristic regulatory behavior.Visualize the original behavior of the circuit in question by constructing a characteristic transfer function.2.In other words, circuits are prompted to produce distinct levels of output based on the concentration of input molecule.This creates a staircase-like curve in the transfer function for the circuit.Each of these tools functions orthogonally to the activity of the other tools; furthermore, each tool is independently tunable to a specific degree.The fundamental constraints of integral circuit components limit the ability to design and construct genetic circuits of arbitrary and highly specific behavior.The inefficiency of the \u0093design-build-test\u0094 cycle which is relied upon for the construction of effective circuit models.Our project aims to provide a modular collection of genetic parts which can specifically and predictably tune the behavior of an arbitrary genetic circuit.Although it is possible to achieve functional genetic circuits in this capacity, greater problems arise regarding the tunability of the product.The RBS library provides a collection of ribosome binding sites of varying strength; replacing the RBS within a circuit alters the translational efficiency of the output.In order to achieve more precise behavioral control, the ability to tune expression levels of regulatory elements to some desired level is vital.Advances in genetic circuit design: Novel biochemistries, deep part mining, and precision gene expression.Such a method would allow control over output expression to be implemented in a more rapid and predictable manner [3].", "design": "", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "It appears that you don t have a PDF plugin for this browser.", "notebook": "", "protocol": "", "result": "The entirety of the circuit

biological control risk that significantly reduces the risk to us and prevents the transport of organisms outside the containment laboratory by clothing.In this course we learn about the correct use of gown, gloves, and eye, face and feet protection.Also, we received training in biological safety by ECOSERVICIOS DEL NORTE, a company that is in charge of the biohazard residues generated in the

"There are only around 4 widely-used N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing systems, while there are over 100 different systems found in natureAHL molecules are not completely system-specific, as crosstalk can occur between systems-this causes problems with developing functional genetic circuitsAHL quorum sensing is used to regulate factors such as virulence and biofilm formation, potentially activating pathogenic bacteria Quorum sensing is the ability of bacteria to scan their surroundings and detect concentrations of their own population.Our goal is to expand the QS toolbox and enable the implementation of higher-order, complex genetic circuitry in synthetic biology.In addition to expanding the QS toolbox, our team felt that an in-depth investigation on the safety of AHLs would be valuable to future quorum sensing research.N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing (QS) is a type of communication that allows bacteria to monitor their population density for the purpose of controlling various group activities such as virulence or luminescence.Some of the sub-projects include: investigating the Aub strain, which originates from unidentified soil bacterium; writing a white paper on addressing potential safety concerns with AHLs, a visual optical density test on AHL production by Senders, a more comprehensive characterization of AHLs produced by our Senders using gas chromatography, a direct comparison induction test on Senders using the well-characterized part F2620, and develop comprehensive safety procedures for the handling of AHLs.In our Human Practices, we gathered information about the dangers of AHLs from experts and literature, developed a safe disposal plan, tested the safe disposal plan as an extension of our F2620 induction tests, and wrote a report on suggestions for the safety of AHLs.From the interviews and questionnaires that we conducted to industry experts, it was clear that AHLs were not a focal point in their safety reviews.The white paper and safe disposal protocol are several of our human practices projects that the ASU team investigated during the course of the project.AHL quorum sensing has a myriad of different systems.A species of bacteria will produce an inducer protein, which generates chemical signals in the form of N-acyl homo-serine lactones (AHLs).Synthetic biologists have taken advantage of the simplicity of the QS system to incorporate signal-processing pathways into genetic circuits.The AHL synthase is expressed in the Sender cell, while the inducible promoter and regulator are carried by a Receiver cell.In addition, we added a safety section to our parts pages that we submitted to the registry.A brief list is shown below:Because there are potential pathogens that could become activated, proper safety measures in the development and production of AHLs were necessary.Our iGEM team is investigating the diverse applications that fit with our quorum sensing project.We have developed a flexible testing platform in which the QS system is separated into two components designated the \u0093Sender\u0094 and the \u0093Receiver\u0094.The objective of our project is to design

modular vector designed for the incorporation of Sender sequences.The Aub, Bja, Bra, Cer, and Sin systems stem from different organisms and their inducers were submitted as parts to the registry with the purpose of completing this induction test.The senders for the Aub, Bja, Bra, Cer, and Sin systems were submitted as part of the inductance test with the F2620 part, and compose a submitted part collection.Utilizing the well characterized Tra system receiver, we created a 3D model of the Tra system binding its native AHL (3-oxo-C8-AHL), in which the interactions between the binding pocket and the AHL acyl tail was demonstrated.This part is designed to incorporate a Sender between two ribosome binding sites (RBSs), and is considered \"modular,\" because the RFC10 prefix is added between the RBSs to allow insertion of any Sender.The 1 composite part is the modular cassette (vector) for the inducer.There are 5 basic parts that are part of the part collection and 1 composite part.Aside from the controls, two different AHL concentrations were used.Our Senders from the Aub, Bja, Bra, Cer and Sin systems were submitted to the registry, while the Esa, Las, Lux, Rhl, and Rpa systems already existed in the registry.This was used by the ASU team to test interactions between inducers from other quorum sensing systems.As shown below, an acyl-acyl carrier protein must react with an intermediate molecule with catalysis from the AHL synthase to produce the AHL.Our team submitted a total of 6 parts to the iGEM registry.The parts that were submitted were all components to N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing systems.With very few Senders currently found in the registry (only around 7), the addition of 5 Senders adds significant depth to the Sender pool.The Aub system was chosen as the system of interest, because of the unknown bacteria of origin and its alkane acyl tail, which are not nearly as well-characterized as the 3-oxo acyl tails from the Lux and Las systems.Additional characterization was done via mass spectrometry, which was done on the Aub system.The 3D structures of the AHLs produced by the systems we examined are found in the Project Description.", "human_practice": "This was done directly after the F2620 inductions test that we conducted for our main project to characterize our ten Senders, and was an extension of that project that we felt would be a good way to test our safe disposal plan.After gathering data from the bleach and autoclave experiments and compiling it with the Borchardt findings, we developed suggestions for the proper disposal of each of the AHL Senders that we constructed and tested, primarily dependent on the structure of the acyl tail found in each AHL.We learned from this paper that 3-oxo AHLs are easily degraded by bleach (due to the reactive beta ketone), but other AHLs were not.We decided to apply the standard EH&S bleach concentration(10%) to extracted and reseeded AHL solutions and allowed them to sit for 10, 20, and 30 minutes.These suggestions and other integrated practices are found on the Integrated Human Practices page.After learning about the lack of available information on AHL safety, we felt that the biosafety concerns resulting from the actual AHL molecules was an area worth investigating.In order to aim for the Gold Medal requirement in Human Practices, we tried to integrate our Human Practices whenever designing or interpreting experiments.", "modeling": "", "notebook": "Each researcher s notes are located at the following links:", "protocol": "If doing gel

"The 10 induction plates along with a negative sender control are shown below:From these results, it can be shown that 8/10 systems induced F2620, with Las and Sin being the two exceptions.Lux, the native system that F2620 was designed for, Las, Rpa, and surprisingly Cer showed an exponential increase in GFP absorbance with an increasing concentration, with much higher levels of absorbance at the 50% AHL concentration as compared to the 10% AHL concentration.The positive control was used as a visual standard for GFP expression in F2620, which, if shown to fluoresce, meant that induction by the AHL Sender was occurring.These results provide a proof-of-concept that the Senders are able to produce AHLs in our selected chassis, as mCherry lies downstream of the Sender in our system, so the AHL is likely produced.Overall, Cer, Esa, Las, Lux, and Rpa showed a significant increase in GFP absorbance over the F2620 control, indicating some degree of crosstalk with F2620.Meanwhile, the Aub, Bja, Bra, Rhl, and Sin systems showed evidence of orthogonality to F2620.Fluorescence found in the middle of the plate by the Senders themselves was likely due to mCherry production, which was constitutively produced alongside the AHL.From solely these results, Aub, Bja, Rhl, and Sin are the strongest candidates to be orthogonal to F2620, with both AHL curves consistently close to control absorbance levels.This test will aim to determine orthogonality between the Senders and F2620 while also providing a direct comparison between systems  inductive capabilities.The Induction test was done by extracting AHLs from the supernatant of a liquid culture and then plating with uninduced cells.While we had successfully sequenced each of the constructed Senders, a proof-of-concept test was conducted on the inducers to demonstrate the likely production of the AHL.Of the 10 systems measured, known crosstalk partners such as Esa, Las, and Rpa showed increased levels of GFP measured as compared to the F2620 control.Of the 8 systems that induced F2620, Esa showed the greatest level of induction, even greater than that of the native system Lux.It is likely that there is a threshold to the mCherry production, which was reached by the Rpa system.If mCherry is produced, this will be a likely indicator that the AHL is also being produced.The figures above demonstrate that when the AHL synthase gene is grown in E. coli, the AHL is likely produced.This data will be available on the parts pages of each Sender, which will confirm that the AHL is being produced within our chassis.Due to time constraints, we will only test the 5 Senders that we submitted to the registry (Aub, Bja, Bra, Cer and Sin).The Modular Sender Vector was submitted within its own backbone, as it was designed with an RFC10 prefix within the part.Inducer Confirmation through Optical Density MeasurementsInitially, after the construction of the 20 Receivers and Senders, the focus of our project centered on the Aub system.By separating the inducer of the AHL from the receptor, crosstalk can be determined between systems.Several systems, like Bja and Las, showed an initial dip in mCherry production during the first two hours of growth.Our measurements were split into 5 curves, with synthetic AHL measurements at 2 concentrations as 2 curves, non-3-oxo AHLs as 1 curve, 3-oxo AHLs as 1 curve, and other acyl structures as the last curve:The figures above demonstrate a mix of orthogonal and intersecting(crosstalk) networks.An 8-hour optical density test was conducted on the 96-well plate, measuring at a wavelength of 600nm to demonstrate overall cellular growth and between 580-610nm to measure mCherry fluorescence.This is likely due to the fact that Esa and Lux produce the same AHL molecule and the Esa construct may be more capable of efficient AHL production than that of Lux.Once the production of AHLs by the Senders was tested via the OD test and gas chromatography as well as induction plates, the direct interaction between the Senders and the well-characterized Bba_F2620 by Barry Canton and Anna Labno from MIT was tested.BraI showed a slight increase in absorbance, making it difficult to conclude the level of interaction between the BraI AHL and F2620.Combining these results with the previous induction plates strongly suggests that Sin is an orthogonal system to Lux.However, we encountered difficulties with the AubR transcription factor, which would not be highly induced in the presence of the Aub AHL.The expanded characterization of N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) systems focused on 10 main systems, which are tabulated in the Project Description.In order to confirm that the AHLs were actually being produced by E. coli, we will run a 30 minute gas chromatography test to characterize any AHLs present.Las was shown to induce by the Canton Lab(2008), so the lack of induction could be due to a molecular diffusion issue.E. coli DH5?T was used for the construction of the Senders and Receivers.SinI had lower absorbance levels in the sample runs than the F2620 control, but still remains in the margin of error for the plate reader.The 10th system, RpaI, had a negative trend in mCherry presence but also had, by far, the highest overall absorbance of mCherry.This system originates from the Lux system and is well-understood, which will likely provide the most immediate utility.This was due to the highly uncharacterized nature of the Aub system as well as possible discoveries of orthogonality between Aub and other system receivers.This was likely due to the transfer of cells from an aerated, incubated environment to 96-well plate.The key differences between our experimental design and his was that A)Dr. Canton s experiment attempted to find maximum GFP production using different AHL concentrations while our experiment measured GFP production over time and B)Dr. Canton s system utilized synthetic AHLs while our AHLs were produced using an E. coli chassis.", "safety": "Any safety concerns that would potentially arise would be reviewed by this committee as well.The lab space in which wet-lab work was done was all classified as BSL1 with the exception of the tissue culture room, which was BSL2.In addition, the majority of encounters with AHLs will occur in a research lab setting.Each individual researcher will be responsible for properly disposing of AHLs while preventing exposure of the AHLs to potentially dangerous pathogens.While the parts that we designed do not directly produce virulence factors, AHLs are capable of potentially activating pathogens and increasing virulence.Because this induction requires specific conditions to be dangerous, an investigation on these safety issues was done in our Human Practices.The viability of using these procedures was investigated as part of our human practices, in which we developed a safe disposal protocol to address any concerns about AHLs.One major biosafety consideration is the experimentation with quorom sensing and how new interactions between AHLs will affect communication between cells.In addition, after reviewing the paper by Borchardt(2001), we learned that bleach is able to inactivate AHLs with a 3-oxo acyl tail but not those without.As a result, AHLs from systems like Lux were treated with bleach, while other AHLs without the 3-oxo acyl tail were autoclaved.The samples that were tested were characterized using Mass Spectrometry to show that the molecules had separated (lactone ring from acyl tail) and thus, were rendered inactive.This research was all with accordance with ASU s Biological Safety Manual, found here.Other work, such as mass spectrometry, was done at the Biodesign Institute at ASU.All ASU team members were trained through EH&S courses in Lab Safety, Hazardous Waste Management, Fire Safety, Biological and Bloodborne Pathogens, Gas Cylinders, and Recombinant DNA.A deeper analysis of these impacts was done under the Human Practices tab.These results were tested in an induction experiment measured in a plate reader for GFP expression, in which autoclaving was shown to completely inactivate all AHLs.The parts that we designed are capable of producing AHLs, but because inserting these parts into bacteria does not directly translate to a sharp increase in pathogenicity, there is very little risk.This organism can be handled in BSL1 conditions and \"presents minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment,\" according to the New England BioLabs SDS.The research in this lab was all completed under Standard Operating Procedures.The lab was located in the 2nd floor wet-lab at Arizona State University s ISTB4 building.In addition, all lab members completed a \"cloning bootcamp,\" in which basic

succeeded in designing this construct by using a leader peptide to enable translational coupling for the first gene and then integrating all following RBSs into the corresponding upstream genes.In

laboratories can afford it.Re-inventing the lab: Development of a highly flexible, affordable and open source robotic automation platformAlmost everyone working or studying in biology have heard about liquid handlers and robots dedicated to biological sciences.1) The consumables used by these robots are expensive and can cost up to 10 times more than the usual consumables found in a laboratory, which is simply too pricey for most research groups to afford for day to day operations.Despite the fact that many know about them, and could potentially use them in their lab, very few scientists actually use automation.One of the main difficulties is getting access to one of these robots.5) Other problems like complicated not sufficiently flexible software tools (with costly updates) or the need to have dedicated personnel trained to run the robots discourage many potential users.Our team has developed an affordable, modular and open source robotic automation platform to address these problems.A second recombineering step could remove this cassette without any residual \u0093scar\u0094 sequence through a counterselection using the inducible toxin.To do so, a \u0093scarless\u0094

then recuperate 1 hour at 37 celsius degrees).Plate all the cells on a LB agar plate containing the right selective antibioticsThe SPRI method for DNA purification that uses the negative charge of the DNA to bind it with PEG onto magnetic beads.Then, we used 1 \u00b5L of both PCR products to do a fusion PCR using kanR-amilCP-igem-ship-F1 and kanR-amilCP-igem-ship-R2 (see the primer table for details on the primers).After that, we purified the PCR product using SPRI method and assembled the construction by gibson assembly using pSB1C3 linearised version provided by the IGEM team.Although it is not tested, we are confident that the cassette should work at least as good as BBa_K1744000.To test the effect of the toxins on the cells containing the different kill swiches:2 ul of culture was used to inoculate 198 ul of LB-ampicillin-Glucose 5% or LB-ampicillin-arabinose 1%The OD[600] was measured at different intervals during 16-24 hours using a plate readerThe only medium used in this project was LB in broth and agar form.This is a problem on many levels: it\u0092s harder to get a clean PCR amplification, the recombineering efficiency and specificity is impaired with long cassette, there is some elements that can be changed or are unnecessary and ampicillin resistance is not a good positive selection marker since it allows satellite colonies to grow within an overnight time lapse due to antibiotic fast degradation.To build it, we used BBa_K1744000 as template in a PCR with the primers pBAD30-vcrx028-igem-ship-F and vcrx028-kan-amilCP-IGEM-ship-R1 to obtain a part of this plasmid that contains the kill switch without the resistance marker.Thus, the marker amilCP, with our promoter and RBS, can not be used as a positive marker in recombineering experiments, but it could serve us as a plasmidic marker to avoid plasmid background and only the gene aph3\u0092-I would serve us as a positive recombineering marker to help us select the good recombinants.To do so, we cannot use our newly constructed recombineering cassette because the toxin will not be able to counter select with a functional vcrx027(the anti-toxin) in the background.So, the pKD4 casette was amplified using vcrx028-KanR-del-F and vcrx028-KanR-del-R (see primer details in the design section).The cassette was then purified by SPRI with agencourt bead ratio 1:1 and digested with DpnI to get rid of plasmidic background.The primer used are lacZ-homology-ext-F and lacZ-homology-ext-R. Then, the cassette was integrated in the genome through recombineering using a pSIM6 containing BW25113 strain.The resulting cassette was then SPRIed using Agencourt beads and used in the recombineering experiment.The recombineering used again the same plasmid pSIM5.The cells were plated on LB streptinomycin, chloramphenicol and arabinose at working concentration and incubated overnight.So, the method can be used, not only to purify DNA, but also to get rid of primers and non-specific bands that are often smaller than the band of interest.It turns out that if the good colonies are blue, or, if any blue colonies can be associated with a clear result (like plasmid background for example), it would be much easier to design an automated system in the BIOBOT to seek and pick only the right colonies for screening.This system will ultimately serve as the basics for automated recombineering using BIOBOT, even if we haven t had the time to actually do it with the robot because of the early deadlines.In order to test our BIOBOT platform (which could ultimately do automated MAGE experiment), a recombineering experiment has to be set-up.After that, we purified the PCR product using SPRI method and assembled the construction by gibson assembly using pSB1C3 linearised version provided by the IGEM team.Firstly, by doing so, we will enable cyclic deletion using our cassette on pVCR94, which is the only plasmidic that we could do so beacause expresses the anti-toxin of vcrx028 which is vcrx027 and would resist to toxin induction.Those clones will be used for phenotypic test of each toxins.The different kill switches (pBAD30-[mosT;ccdB;mazF;vcrx028]) were tested (see here for the protocol) to investigate if they worked and to know which one was the best.The cells are heated up to denature it s proteins and lysate it so in the supernatant we get only the partially denatured DNA with denatured proteins.Mix 10 \u00b5L of dense culture (overnight is far more than sufficient) to 100 \u00b5L of Chelex (5%w/v in water)Incubate 10 minutes at 100 degrees Celsius (you can put your tube in the PCR to make a program that does both incubations for you)Transfers 50 \u00b5L of the supernatant in another microtube.The procedures are specified by the manufacturer, but here is how we do it:Design your primers to have at least 20 bp of homology on both sides for the adjacent part on your futur DNA construction.Using the part in that fashion, if the colonies would be blue, it would be plasmidic background and if they would be white, then they would be recombinants (since the expression of amilCP in single copy is not visible).This part contains a portion of BBa_K1744000 and the whole sequence of BBa_K1744001.Traditionally, the recombineering technique use an antibiotic resistance gene as a positive selection system.Basically, the DNA source of the transformation doesn\u0092t need to be pure for a chemical transformation and can be highly concentrated in salt.We decided to use Aph3\u0092-II, the resistance gene to kanamycin from pKD4, a commercially available plasmid that have the characteristic to have flanking FRT sequence at both sides of the Aph3\u0092-II gene.exo firstly degrades one of the two strands of a double stranded DNA fragment through its 5\u0092->3\u0092 exonuclease activity.We found that mosT and vcrx028 were the best counter-selectable markers (see here for the results)Our multi-copy plasmid results shown that mosT and vcrx028 were the best candidates for our system, but we needed to test them in single-integrated-copy for it to be more representative.Then the two purified products were used in a gibson assembly with the linearized pSB1C3 provided by the IGEM team to obtain the whole sequence of BBa_K1744002 in pSB1C3.To assess these concern, the cassette needs to be modified in order to be smaller, more efficient in PCR amplification and recombineering and easier to work with in screening assays.Even if adding this chromoprotein to the cassette makes it bigger it can still be worth it if the difference between negative and positive clones can become more visual.To build this part, we ordered a gBlock from IDT containing a P1U8 driven amilCP ORF.Secondly, the goal of this experiment is to test the recombineering in a relatable context.Therefore, we amplified cassettes containing all the needed elements of the kill switches from pBAD30-[mosT;vcrx028] (which are basically AraC with its promoter, inducible toxin with promoter and terminator and bla gene from pBAD30) with primers (killswitch_ins_LacZ_F and killswitch_ins_LacZ_R) adding homologies that allow lambda-red mediated recombination in the lacZ truncated gene of Escherichia coli BW25113.Again, one primer on two binded in the cassette and the other one binded in pVCR94.The primers (vcrx027-del-F and vcrx027-del-R) listed in  of the design section are used to amplify the cassette as described in the same section.You can see the result in vcrx027 clean deletion resultsOne major aspect not discussed in the previous sections about our cassette is that it is really big.The primer used for amplification of the cassette were pBAD30-vcrx028-igem-ship-F and pBAD30-vcrx028-igem-ship-R.After the gibson, DNA was transformed using chemically competent cell into E. coli EC100 strain.To do so, primers described in the design sections were used on different template: pSXT, ptac-ccdb-cassette, gBlock_FG1, pVCR94.Then another PCR was done on BBa_K1744001 with the primers vcrx028-kan-amilCP-IGEM-ship-F2 and vcrx028-kan-amilCP-IGEM-ship-R2 (see the primer table for details on the primers) to get its whole sequence.The principle under this method is that chelex beads display chelator molecules that bind to the ions released by the cells that could inhibit PCR.The recipe for all PCR mix is as follow:The PCR mixes were all done on ice and we followed manufacturer\u0092s recommendation for denaturation and elongation temperature.For TFBI and TFBII composition, please refer to other reagents section.Dilute digestion samples 1:2 at least to get better DNA yield.Place your tube on a magnetic rack and wait for the beads to aggregate on the side of the tube.Once dry, resuspend the beads in molecular grade water in the volume needed for further experiments.Transfers your tube on the magnetic rack again and wait for the beads to aggregate on the side of the tube.Chelex DNA purification is a quick and cheap method for DNA purification.Unfortunately, we had problems amplifying the cassette in order to integrate it in the genome so we did not have the chance to test the cassette.See the results for the cassette insertion in pKD4 insertion result section.We can now test our cassette through vcrx027 deletion.The clones were confirmed by digestion and lyophilised for IGEM shipping.This part is the optimisation conclusion of the final deletion cassette.In each case, one of the two primer in internal to the pKD4 cassette and will only bind to pVCR94 if the pKD4 cassette was successfully integrated.After that, the isolated colonies are picked and inoculated in LB broth containing the same antibiotics and glucose amounts.Since the kanamycin marker is no longer wanted in pVCR94 and is adjacent to the gene to delete, we will delete it as well.For schematique details on the resulting plasmid, please visit:The clones for each construction were screened by digestion (results not shown) and good clones for each constructions were obtained.After that, the isolated colonies are picked and inoculated in LB broth containing the same antibiotics and arabinose amounts.After that, the isolated colonies are picked and inoculated in LB broth containing the same antibiotics amounts.The full protocol is available with the kit purchase.IMPORTANT NOTE: This technique can be affected by the buffer in which the DNA lies.Both come from BIOBASIC, their catalog numbers are SD7002(S518) and SD7003(S519).Here are the complete list of antibiotics used in this project with the working concentration for each:TFBI:30 mM KOAc, 100 mM RbCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 50 mM MnCl2, 15 % glycerol, pH 5.8 (adjusted with acetic acid), 0.22 \u00b5m filtered.TFBII:10 mM MOPS or PIPES, 75 mM CaCl2, 10 mM RbCl, 15 % glycerol, pH 6.5 (adjust with KOH), 0.22 \u00b5m filtered.The polymerase used for all experiment was Veraseq from Enzymatics\u0099.They were used as described in the primer table in the design section.You can also see in the results that the colonies with BBa_K1744001 inserted in single copy in the genome were not really blue.All the tested clones for mosT shown that behavior, but only 1 of the 3 vcrx028 clones did.Those plasmid are thermosensible (the origin of replication do not work at 37 degrees Celsius) and the lambda red system is heat induced.See the protocol or See the resultsSince vcrx028 seems to work better than other toxins, we decide to use it in order to test a cyclic recombineering cassette using the as template.pVCR94 is a plasmid isolated during the 1994 cholerae outbreak in a Rwanda refugee camp.This part is basically just the previously described cassette, but transferred in pSB1C3 for IGEM shipping of the part.This comes from the fact that recombineering uses lambda red system.As the primer name says, the first pair screened the 5\u0092 end of the insertion and the second pair screened the 3\u0092 end section of the insertion.Furthermore, the longer the DNA molecule, the more affinity it will have for the beads because it carries more negative charge than smaller DNA fragments.After confirmation of the recombinants, they were tested and it shown that both killswitch were still working even in single copy.All of these primers are described in the primer table .The cassette basically contain an araC gene for repression, an arabinose inducible vcrx028 toxin and a resistance gene for ampicillin (bla), see the part description for full design information.As shown in the results, all the recombinants tested were good.We will firstly need to take out vcrx028 to take out vcrx027 with our cassette and make our cassette \u0093pop-out\u0094 with a fusion PCR of both adjacent regions.The first thing to do is to delete vcrx028 from pVCR94.That be said, we still have a working cassette with strong results to send to IGEM Headquarters as a part.Preliminary results will not be shown for they are not necessary to the comprehension of this section.To do so BBa_K1744001 was amplified using kanR-amilCP-lacZ-ins-F and kanR-amilCP-lacZ-ins-R. Then 1 \u00b5L of a 1/100 dilution of PCR product was used in a second round of PCR to enlarge the homologies to 80 bp approximately.All PCR except those specified in the text were made with 50 Celsius degrees as annealing temperature.The inserts and the vector were then mixed for Gibson experiment.It was designed to contain the advantages of both preceding parts : the working vcrx028 kill switch and the dual positive marker amilCP-aph.The results for the clean deletion was perfect.Than a polymerase will fill the sequence left empty by the exonuclease and a ligase will join both strands together.The DNA of those clones was then extracted using Chelex method and screened through PCR using 2 different pairs of primers.There is two major adds and changes to the protocol.The gibson reaction was then entirely transformed in chemically competent cells (EC100Dpir+ strain) and plated on LB kanamycin, chloramphenicol and glucose 5%.It contains kanamycin resistance from pOK12 (a commercially available plasmid) which is a truncated, shorter version of Aph3\u0092-I and amilCP, a deep blue chromoprotein Biobrick standardised by a previous IGEM team from part BBa_K592009.In this section, we will detail the experiments leading to a fully working clean deletion system through recombineering.2015 for details, this version had the multiple resistance genes region deleted and replaced by Spectinomycin resistance).Those two fact explains the major changes in the protocol.The aspects of the colonies was indeed deep blue.The gibson reaction was then entirely transformed in chemically competent cells (EC100Dpir+ strain) and plated on LB ampicillin, chloramphenicol and glucose 5%.The plasmid used was still pSIM5.The cells were plated on LB ampicillin, streptinomycin, chloramphenicol and glucose at working concentration and incubated overnight.(2000) and uses three protein for the lambda phage: bet, gam, exo.It is now a well known technique that uses an exonuclease to degrade 5\u0092->3\u0092 one strand of DNA, permitting the homology regions to merge.The 3 \u0091 region was also amplified on the same distance with vcrx027-28-clean-del-3 -F and vcrx027-28-clean-del-3 -R.Store at -80\u00b0C.When needed, cells can be thawed 15 minutes on ice before using them for transformationLet cells recuperate 1 hour at 37 degrees before plating them on the right selective plate.To execute this protocol, make sure you have access to an electroporator and be carefull handling the device, as its function is to give electric pulses.Furthermore, we know that recombineering works in pVCR94 since there are quite a few articles that have used this technique to modify its sequence (one of these is Carraro et al.The gibson reaction was then entirely transformed in chemically competent cells (EC100Dpir+ strain) and plated on LB kanamycin and chloramphenicol.The DNA of each clones were prepared using the Chelex method and were screened using vcrx028-KanR-del-F with vcrx027-28-del-verif-R; and vcrx027-28-del-verif-F with vcrx028-KanR-del-R.The DNA of each clones were prepared using the Chelex method and were screened using 5 _pVCR94_del_verif_F with 5 _pVCR94_del_verif_R; and 3 _pVCR94_del_verif_F with 3 _pVCR94_del_verif_R.You can use 1 \u00b5L for each PCR as template DNAThe DNA of each clones were prepared using the Chelex method and were screened using vcrx027-28-del-verif-F and vcrx027-28-del-verif-R.To do so, adjacent 5\u0092 region of vcrx027 was amplified on about 200 bp using vcrx027-28-clean-del-5 -F and vcrx027-28-clean-del-5 -R.It uses Chelex beads (available commercially) and heat to extract poor quality DNA for PCR screening only.Our team is sorry about that, but since the cassette will be optimised, we have put more effort on actually improving the cassette than making it Biobrick proof.", "result": "For the right side of the gel, the same clones in the same order were screened for the 3\u0092 end of the insertion with a primer binding in the 5\u0092 of the inserted cassette.We kept clone # 3 for further experiments because it was the one with the lowest background of non-specific amplification.The above gel shows a representative success rate of BBa_K1744000.The result shown above demonstrate that the insertion had a 100% rate of success.It was also measured with culture in 1% arabinose LB broth to show the effect of toxin induction on the cells.It was also measured with culture in 1% arabinose LB broth to show the effect of toxin induction on the cells.The success rate of the method is, so far, of 100%.In order to assay the expression of amilCP in single copy, it was inserted through recombineering in lacZ gene in E. coli K-12 substr.The cells were photographed to show the difference between cells with the plasmidic form of amilCP gene and the inserted version of the gene:In this previous image, you can see the appearance of colonies on LB agar when they carry plasmidic or genomic amilCP-KanR cassette.But, with amilCP, the plasmidic background will be eliminated rapidly because the colonies will be deep blue instead of white therefore accelerating the screening and eliminating a good proportion of the background.You can see that only the control exhibits a different amplicon size, and that all clones have the sized band.The presence of a band in the red rectangle means the clone is good.We can see that after 10-12 hours, all the tested clones of mosT recombinants and 1 of the vcrx028 ones started growing even if arabinose was present.This was achieved through PCR screening as described in the experiment section.As it can be seen on the above gel, all of the clone exhibit the correct size band.The horizontal axis shows a time lapse and the vertical one the optical density (OD) measured at 600 nm.The horizontal axis shows a time lapse and the vertical one the optical density (OD) measured at 600 nm.In a recombineering experiment, the longest part if often the screening.The optical density serves as an indicator of cell concentration in the medium, the more concentrated the cells are, the higher the OD.The optical density serves as an indicator of cell concentration in the medium, the more concentrated the cells are, the higher the OD.The only thing that is not good about this result is that there is non-specific amplification in all of the clones.The second primer pair (at right) produces a 1.7 kb band if kanR-amilCP was successfully inserted in the genome and a 1.2 kb band if it did not.Therefore, we conclude that vcrx028 is the most fitted counter-selectable marker for our clean deletion system.This section shows the results for pKD4\u0092s cassette insertion in pVCR94 and deletion of vcrx028.In the other hand, it would be unlikely that the predicted band could be non-specific because we screened with two primer pairs for confirmation.For the first series of amplification, the clones were tested for 5\u0092 end of the insertion, with a primer binding in the 3\u0092 of the cassette.It also shows that both mosT and vcrx028 are the most deadly among the tested toxins.Note that the data were normalized with the initial OD[600].As you can see, the expression of amilCP in single copy is not sufficient to make the colonies blue even faintly.As you can see, the success rate is really high.The clone order is the same on 5\u0092 and 3\u0092 screening.The first one (at left) produce a 875 bp amplicon if insertion of the part in the genome is successful but no bands if it failed.Note that the data were normalized with the initial OD[600].Therefore, no product should be visible if the cassette was not inserted at the right place.Thing is that we restarted the PCR verification multiple times but we could not get rid of the non-specific binding.", "safety": "Of course, like for mechanical tests, we had our glasses on, and, if required, when we were using a reflow-oven, using gloves to manipulate the PCB afterwards.All manipulations implying a living organism have been executed in a certified level 1 biosecurity laboratory.Here are some examples of the biggest safety concerns we had during our project.A standard procedure we followed when testing new mechanical assembly, for examples the platform motion system or the centrifuge plate spinning, we would always wear safety glasses.That way, risk to damage the equipment and ourselves were lower than to run a full speed test right away.When soldering our BananaBoard PCBs, to ensure our safety and proper assembly method, we always used suitable equipment located in a controlled environment.Also, to help detect problems and prevent it, we would start with a low speed test and doing faster tests as the previous was concluding.So, when testing new design for the first time, or trying new things with them, safety was a concern we needed to deal with.For our project, we design a lot of new electrical and mechanical systems.All

our Gemini library plasmids with three multimerized operator sites upstream of a minimal promoter driving GFP, one of which was submitted to the iGEM registry under the code BBa_K1875018.The CMV fluoresced twice as bright as the single operator promoter plasmid BBa_K1875016 (denoted by the singular operator site) and about a fourth as bright as the triple operator promoter plasmid (denoted by the triple operator site).CMV compared to three Gemini single operator promoters (BBa_K1875014, BBa_K1875015, and BBa_K1875016 respectively).The CMV expressed GFP at a greater intensity than all of the single operator promoters with the sole exception of the promoter containing the g3 operator.BBa_I712004 compared to four triple operator promoters.We measured fluorescence of the CMV promoter device relative to these devices.Parts BBa_K1875014, BBa_K1875015, and BBa_K1875016 correspond to three of our single operator promoters driving GFP.Our experiment, however, does reveal the relative strength of the CMV promoter device as compared to both of our well-characterized parts.BBa_I712004 compared to two Gemini operator promoter plasmids containing the same gRNA operator.Our team worked to improve the characterization of a CMV promoter, BBa_I712004, part from the iGEM Registry.The CMV fluoresced anywhere between a third to a fifth as brightly as the four triple operator promoters.", "design": "To obtain our system of well characterized mammalian digital and analog promoters, we divided our research into three technical aims:Integration of our parts into genetic circuit contexts To complete these goals we made use of three classes of plasmids: a constitutive guide RNA expressing vector, a guide RNA operator reporter vector driven by a minimal CMV, and a constitutive dCas9-VPR complex.Once the library was expanded out into the analog domain, we begun integrating our library into genetic logic circuits.We wanted to make sure that there was no cross talk that would generate undesired outputs under the wrong conditions.After establishing the digital library, we moved to expand into our full analog library.Seeing that the problem we wanted to address had a natural duality to it (digital and analog), we decided to develop Gemini.First, our system had to be orthogonal to the human genome.In a biological context, a binary output would be the expression or absence of expression of a gene of interest.When fused, however, to the VPR, a strong activating complex of transcription regulators, the dCas9 becomes an activating complex that can drive the production of a gene of interest.What attracted us most to this name was the fact that while each of the twins was a hero in their own regard, they were far more powerful together.While digital and analog promoter networks are individually impressive, the ability to control both networks through one system is the ultimate goal.These circuit are defined by their analog output of a single gene as well as their ignorance towards input order.In addition to those parameters, we also increased the distance between binding sites on the multimerized plasmids in another attempt to increase expression.The second type of circuit is the combinatorial analog logic circuit.The first is a combinatorial digital logic circuit.We did this using two main hypotheses: the multimerization of binding sites would increase expression and the mutation of binding sites would decrease expression.dCas9, like its sister system Cas9, works by using CRISPR\u0092s targeting system and a guide RNA to find a specific sequence.This behavior needed to be maintained across multiple genes of interest.Finally, we needed to motivate that components of our system were mutually orthogonal.In a biological context, this behavior can be modelled by increasing the expression of gene as one shifts from a given logical state to another logical state.In the case of the former, the multimerization would recruit a greater number of dCas9-VPR\u0092s upstream of the minimal promoter.This system s name refers to the twins Castor and Pollux in Greek mythology.The two assaying techniques used throughout our research were flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy (the latter courtesy of Worcester Polytechnic Institute\u0092s iGEM Team).Integrating our Library into Genetic Circuit ContextsThere were two distinct class of circuits we aimed to develop.Where they differ is in how the proteins interact with the genome.We did not want to activate off target genes in the human genome.While Cas9 has a nuclease that can cleave the DNA, dCas9\u0092s nuclease is catalytically inhibited.", "human_practice": "Also, we got valuable feedback from these iGEM teams as well as from LabCentral specialists.Both BostonU iGEM

imagination and skill.As NTNU\u0092s contribution to the 2016 international iGEM competition, we will make a system for introducing logic gates in living cells.We believe that the introduction of logic gates in living cells will have applications in fields ranging from medicine to environmental science and industrial biotechnology.We will use replicons and msDNA to accomplish this.The msDNA based logic that we are using is based on the ability of certain DNAs, called deoxyribozymes to cleave DNAs and RNAs at defined positions.The implementation of these logic gates is the foundation for all of the life-changing applications computer technology has provided.We will use short DNA logic inside living cells and show that it works.Using complementarity (straight sections) to find a specific locus on the RNA molecule, the nuclease binds to it and cleaves it, using a catalytic loop (red capital) next to a G nucleotide (green capital).Living cells are basically computers whose task is to create more of themselves, and they are very good at it.These machines are called replicons and the short pieces of DNA that they produce are called msDNA.In order to achieve this, we are making a system for engineering in vivo logic gates.That is how our current project came into fruition.In a world where computers are getting increasingly life-like, it is our goal to introduce computational logic in living organisms.In the picture we can see a DNA nuclease (red) bound to an RNA molecule (green).Short pieces of DNA have been demonstrated to perform complex logic tasks in test tubes and are much easier to engineer.Our goal is to bring the great potential of computer technology, such as developing a new generation of biosensors, improving the process of industrial fermentations, or advancing cancer research to the field of biological engineering.We have created scripts to design our logic gates.For our proof of concept we are making an XOR logic gate.However, some viruses do, and when they infect cells they sometimes leave behind the machinery that they use to make short DNAs.The reason is that proteins are an essential part of the cell s control-system and they are almost

have sinusoidal oscillations of the type A(t)=Ao+A1 sin??(?t+ ?)?The results from the oscillations showed that the oscillations should synchronise over time, and if each figure is broken down into 100 sample blocks, and the mean fluorescence in each of these individual blocks will give a variance of < 0.05*moving average of mean value (figure 5), which is what we decided to do.The wavelengths of the yepGFP and mRFP1 were set according to the absorption spectra [19, 20] and are listed as follows: The same experimental setup and procedure followed were the same for the testing of both the Danino oscillator and the iDanino oscillator, and is listed as follows:E.coli DH5? cultures for the positive control (containing the plasmid BBa_2173001) , negative control (containing the plasmid BBa_K2173000), and our iDanino circuit (containing both plasmids BBa_K2173000 and BBa_K2173001) were grown overnight to the stationary phase (O.D.600 ~ 2).500 \u00b5l of each of these cultures was picked up and diluted 1/20th in 250ml conical flasks containing 10 ml LB medium with the respective antibiotics.The fluorescence values obtained were then normalized for the small changes in OD due to experimental errors using curve fitting through support vector regression in R, followed by plotting of the fluorescence value versus time for the root mean square value of the OD for each of the cultures, and the trends were analyzed.We decided to use this circuit to characterise the oscillations of two systems, the first being the Danino oscillator [21], and the second one being the iDanino (Module \u0096 2, iGEM IIT Delhi 2016) in two separate experiments, in order to characterise this burst of fluorescence for the two reporters, yemGFP (sfGFP) and mRFP1 respectively.The sample was placed in a quartz glass fluorimetry cuvette, and emission at the wavelength given above was noted over time at the given value of excitation wavelength (along with the OD600 values).It has been reported in literature that when the number of cells is higher than ~200 \u0096 500, we do not see oscillations, but instead there is a burst of fluorescence emanating from the center of the culture, which then spreads out and dies.Media containing 0.075% Tween20 was then loaded onto the media port as a reservoir, and was left as is, for flow through the channel due to capillary forces.E.coli DH5?

BBa_K2173001) were grown overnight to the stationary phase (O.D.600 ~ 2).Cells were pushed into the trap, and the residual culture was washed out.The principle of this device is that it excites a culture filled in a quartz glass cuvette, with light of a certain wavelength, and then measures the emission at a set wavelength, using a collector which is set at right angles to the plane in which the excitation light passes.value of the cultures (this 1 ml replacement of media was found to be optimal, after calculating the growth curve (figure 2) of the iDanino circuit and it\u0092s positive and negative controls).Cultures were spun at extremely low speed (20 rpm), to provide an analogue of flow rate, appearing in the equation for external AHL in the modelling of the iDanino oscillator, found to be essential for maintaining oscillation/burst behavior of the cells.We analysed how a system of \u0091n\u0092 cells would behave over time by integration of the behavior over an instantaneous time scale dt.1 ml sample from each of the cultures was taken and replaced with 1ml of fresh media, in order to maintain a near constant O.D.In the device, E. coli cells are loaded from the cell port while keeping the media port at sufficiently higher pressure than the waste port below to prevent contamination.The flow was then reversed and allowed for cells to receive fresh media with 0.1% Tween20 which prevented cells from adhering to the main channels and waste ports.The excitation and emission wavelengths can be set manually, depending on the absorption spectra of the fluorescent proteins.", "human_practice": "", "modeling": "We performtwo sub-experiments in this category with two different values of diffusion.Diffusion = 200 ?m2/s The results for this experiment

diffusion synchronization is supported for largerFurther, from figures M11, M12, M15 and M16 it is clear than HOTFMshows better synchronization and that too for a longer period of time.Also, we get better synchronization with larger diffusion.The frequency of oscillation is always greater for HOTFM compared toFrom M17 it is clear that Danino has a larger amplitude than HOTFM onFurther, video V3 shows the temporal evolution of AiiA concentration for cells numbered 10, 30, 50, 70 and the mean concentration as well; here it is visibly evident that AiiA concentration across cells and the mean oscillate in phase.Figures M2 andM3 show the spatiotemporal heatmaps for the concentration of AiiA for DaninoIf we add noise to the parameters and start the cells with slightly different intialconditions, simulations show that in the absence of diffusion cells are completelyoff phase with each other as shown in Figures M4(Danino) and M5(HOTFM).Further, the time evolution for each cell is shown in Figures M6(Danino) andM7(HOTFM).This is the term that captures the synchronizednature of the oscillators; the movement of AHL across the cell membranes allowsthe cells to communicate with their neighbors regarding the state of oscillations.For HOTFM, we need to modify the Danino model to account for self-repressionon AiiA.This is a deterministic model for intracellular concentrationsof LuxI(I ), AiiA(A), internal AHL(Hi) and external AHL(He)describes the delayed production of corresponding proteins, it depends on thepast concentration of the internal AHL, H?(t) = Hi(t-?).For this purpose, we have conducted three different sets of experiments:Diffusion with initial conditions nonzero across all cellsHere, we assume that initially all the cells have nonzero concentration of LuxI.We take a linear array of 100 cells; and assign a set of 4 equationsto each cell for the Danino Oscillator and a set of 6 equations for HOTFM.A sufficient flowrate is necessary to ensure diffusion of AHL to ensure oscillations in the system.If we look at equation 2.1 qualitatively, it tells us that AiiA is activated by thepast concentration of internal AHL in the cell; thus, capturing the causal nature ofAiiA\u0092s activation by the AHL produced by LuxI.Here, we see that at each time point the phases for all the cellsare not visibly not in synchronization, thus yielding a very low amplitude for thevideo V1 shows the temporal evolution of AiiA concentration for cells numbered10, 30, 50, 70 and the mean concentration as well, thus supporting the hypothesisthat for zero diffusion there is no synchronization.Here, it is quite evident that addition of self repression on AiiA has reducedthe amplitude and thus the time period of oscillations, as hypothesized; Daninohas 21 peaks over a time frame of 1500 minutes, while HOTFM shows 26 peaks.Having established the importance of diffussion for synchronization, it is imperative to conduct simulations to compare the diffusion behavior between Danino andHOTFM.Ideally, for synchronized similar oscillators amplitude histogram should oscillate at the system frequency with a very narrow spread about its mean.Though the histogram is not quite narrow at times, but we can see a similar trend.Figure M18 is the spatio-temporal heatmap for mixing between Danino and HOTFM.We have an 1D array of 200 cells; cells numbered 1 to 100 are the Danino oscillators, while those numbered 101 to 200 are HOTFM systems.Once we have a model, it is imperative to decide upon the values for the associated parameters.And as AiiA degrades enzymatically below a threshold, productionFor this set of experiments, we assume a nonzero value for the diffussion coefficient and observe oscillation synchronizaton under different initial conditions.As the AiiA concentration shoots beyond a level,it suppresses the AHL concentration, thus further halting the production of both AiiA and LuxI.For internalAHL in 2.3, we can see that it is being activated by LuxI as well as it is positivelyaffected by the difference with external AHL concentration.Essentially, we have the null hupothesis that there are no oscillationsand by solving the Danino model we show the alternative hypothesis to be true.The result for this in-silico experiment is shown in Figure M1.The topology of connection is only of limited used with regards to a complete understanding sucha system; thus, we could impose a dynamical system over this graphical model.Now, the nature of this dynamical model would depend on the task at a hand; depending on our need we might be looking at a deterministic model or a stochastic model.Thus, the modified and new equations are as follows:To study the quantitative solutions of the Danino model1, we look at two broad1.We start with the original model of the Danino oscillator [4]; discuss it simplications and suggest modifications to this model so as to incorporate the ideaFor the sake of completeness, the model for Danino is replicated here as well fromequations 2.1 - 2.4.For instance, this biological circuit could be a generegulatory network [6]; we could model such a system by a graph structure capturing the pattern of connections between the genes in the network.Specifically, mathematical modeling can serve two distinct tasks: offering a detailedunderstanding of the dynamics of a biological circuit and/or the design of a novelcircuit.Mathematical modelling and simulations implementing those models play apivotal role between the concept and realization of a biological circuit [9].For an explanatory task, we would estimate them from experimental data; and for circuit design these values would be driven by biological constraints and/or a sweeping of the parameter space to identify values for which the system exhibits the desired behavior.Realizing the significance of the assistance modelling offers in circuit design, inthis section we provide details for the various in-silico experiments conductedby our team.To achieve this, we add two more equations to the model and modifyequaation 2.1.Second, we include the diffusion term and observe the cells as synchronizationThe aim of this experiment is to establish whether an individual cell is oscillatingor not.Figure M1 shows one possible way to outline the modelling procedure.Generally, we begin with a mathematical model

B., & Ellis, T. (2015).An alternative model for explaining TT to CC mutations at CPD sites involves the activity of error-prone DNA polymerases, including the tendency of E. coli pol V to incorrectly add adenine across from a CPD site (Ikehata & Ono, 2011).Our decision to analyze 8OH-G oxidative mutations is rooted in the rich scientific literature linking the chemical mechanism and physiological consequences of these ROS-induced DNA lesions.In addition to directly catalyzing the formation of dipyrimidine photoproducts, UV radiation also primes the genome for a second class of environmentally induced DNA mutations.In particular, the hydroxide free radical is involved in a reaction with guanine residues that produces 8-hydroxyguanine (8OH-G).Cells that must produce progeny and are less able to replicate under a given set of environmental conditions are likely to be overtaken in a heterogeneous population where other clones are not under burdened by the same load (Ceroni et al., 2014).Dewar valence isomers, the third type of environmentally relevant DNA photoproducts induced by solar radiation.During a round of replication, these former CC nucleotides are swapped for TT through erroneous base-pairing with deaminated di-uracil CPD\u0092s.Rejection of foreign DNA in gene therapy and unintended effects of GMOs are driven by the effect of metabolic load and selective pressures on genes which push them toward inactivation or deletion.Increasing the metabolic load of the cell he been shown to decrease the rate of replication, which is correlated with decreased Darwinian fitness.Moreover, the cost of translating active proteins and producing secondary metabolites elevates the chemical stress experienced by the cell for a further decrease in fitness.It is well established that UV does not inflict nucleotide-level DNA damage in a random manner.Though the metabolic load itself is deleterious to a cell\u0092s ability to survive, an even greater danger is posed by increasing cellular load through stress-induced mutagenesis.Shown below is a survey of the wide array of reduction and oxidation products generated by common ROS species such as hydroxide and superoxide radicals.This common oxidative lesion is associated with both UV-dependent and UV-independent environmental insults through the ROS mutagenesis pathway.While oxidation of nucleotides by endogenous produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) threatens cells even during states of basal metabolic activity, UV radiation exacerbates cellular conditions by stimulating photosensitive biological molecules such as riboflavin and porphyrin to increase ROS production.The cytosine residues at CPD sites are particularly susceptible to spontaneous deamination, a reaction that can demonstrably convert di-cytosine CPD\u0092s to di-uracil CPD\u0092s.Reported hotspots of 8OH-G oxidative mutation include the ras and p53 loci in cancer cells, and tissue-specific accumulation of 8OH-G has been associated with pathological conditions such as coronary heart disease (Cooke et al., 2003).Several models attempt to explain the resolution of these modified pyrimidine photoproducts into stable UV signature mutations.Certain sequence motifs are rife substrates for mutagenesis upon exposure to the normal range of 290-400 nm UV present in the environment.When the normal balance of ROS and anti-oxidant chemistry is tipped in favor of oxidation, free radicals wreak havoc on the genome.Ultraviolet radiation from solar and industrial sources represents a major threat to the genomic integrity of engineered organisms.", "description": "", "design": "To optimize mCherry construct resistant to oxidation, an artificial DNA sequence, we employed the algorithm for modifying gene

rate of oxidation with respect to guanine superadditivity.As there were separate synthetic sequences testing for oxidation and irradiation, similarly we had a mCherry construct for oxidation and GFP for UV irradiation.Synthetic sequences consisted of constructs designed for irradiation with ultra-violet and oxidation.The synthetic sequences were developed to have a certain susceptibility to mutations as increased number of pyrimidine dimer hot-spots or consecutive guanine residues.With these two applicable constructs optimized to be resistant to both irradiation and oxidation, the lacZ gene was optimized for both irradiation and oxidation using same procedures with the algorithm developed.To generate this artificial DNA sequence, we wrote an algorithm that modified a seed sequence until it met parameters for the number of di-pyrimidine sites and other constraints to make it compatible with current DNA synthesis restrictions.Applied sequences were sequences that were actually genes, and were used in our experimental methodology in order to observe a realistic example of mutation rates.There were synthetic and applied sequences in this methodology.We custom-designed sequences to test specific hypotheses about sites that modulate a gene s risk of mutation in response to ultraviolet irradiation and oxidative exposure.The experimental approach also tested applied sequences for both oxidation and UV-irradiation.To generate this GFP variant with enhanced mutation resistance, we made synonymous codon substitutions to the commonly used E1010 RFP sequence in the registry.At these motifs, synonymous codon substitutions were made to eliminate oxidation-prone nucleotide sequences and replace them with ones with a lower mutation risk.", "human_practice": "",
